Book OnePsalm 1 – The Way of HappinessRevision 2
\v 1 Happy are thosewho do not follow the counsel of the wicked, not halting in ways frequented by sinners, nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.
\v 2 But the law of the LORD is their joy, they study it day and night.
\v 3 They are like treesplanted by runlets of water, yielding fruit in due season, leaves never fading. In all that they do, they prosper.
\v 4 Not so fare the wicked, not so; like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
\v 5 So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment, nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
\v 6 For the way of the righteous is dear to the LORD, but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.

Psalm 2 – The Lord’s Chosen KingRevision 2
\v 1 Why this turmoil of nations, this futile plotting of peoples,
\v 2 with kings of the earth conspiring, and rulers consulting together, against the LORD and against his anointed,
\v 3 to snap their bondsand fling their cords away?
\v 4 He whose throne is in heaven laughs, the LORD mocks them.
\v 5 Then he speaks to them in his wrath, and in his hot anger confounds them.
\v 6 “This my king is installed by me, on Zion my holy mountain.”
\v 7 I will tell of the LORD’s decree. He said to me: “You are my son, this day I became your father.
\v 8 Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations, and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.
\v 9 You will break them with sceptre of iron, shatter them like pottery.”
\v 10 So now, you kings, be wise: be warned, you rulers of earth.
\v 11 Serve the LORD in awe, kiss his feet with trembling,
\v 12 lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin; for soon will his fury blaze. Happy all who take refuge in him.

Psalm 3 – A Morning Prayer for ProtectionRevision 2A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.
\v 1 How many, LORD, are my foes! Those who rise up against me are many.

\v 3 But you, LORD, are shield about me, my glory, who lifts up my head.
\v 4 When loudly I call to the LORD, from his holy hill he gives answer. Selah
\v 5 I laid down and slept: now I wake, for the LORD sustains me.
\v 6 I fear not the myriads of peoplewho beset me on every side.
\v 7 Arise, LORD: save me, my God, who strikes all my foes on the cheek, and shatters the teeth of the wicked.
\v 8 Victory belongs to the LORD: let your blessing descend on your people. Selah

Psalm 5 – A Prayer for GuidanceRevision 2For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute.
\v 1 Hear my words, LORD: give heed to my whisper.
\v 2 Attend to my loud cry for help, my king and my God.
\v 3 When I pray to you, LORD, in the morning, hear my voice. I make ready for you in the morning, and look for a sign.
\v 4 For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness: no one of evil can be your guest.
\v 5 No braggarts can stand in your presence, you hate all workers of wrong.
\v 6 You destroy all speakers of lies, people of blood and deceit you abhor.
\v 7 But I, through your kindness abundant, may enter your house, and towards the shrine of your templemay reverently bow.
\v 8 Lead me, LORD, in your righteousnessbecause of my enemies. Make your way level before me.
\v 9 For their mouth is a stranger to truth, their heart is a pit of destruction. Their throat is a wide open grave, their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.
\v 10 Condemn them, God; let their schemes bring them down to the ground. For their numberless crimes thrust them downfor playing the rebel against you.
\v 11 But let all who take refuge in youring out their gladness forever. Protect those who love your name, so they may exult in you.
\v 12 For you give your blessing, LORD, to the godly, and the shield of your favor protects them.

Psalm 6 – A Cry for Help in Time of TroubleRevision 2For the leader; with instrumental music on the sheminith. A psalm of David.
\v 1 Rebuke me not, LORD, in your anger, punish me not in your wrath.
\v 2 LORD, be gracious to mein my weakness. Heal me LORD, for racked is my body;
\v 3 all of me utterly racked. Why do you wait so long, LORD?
\v 4 Turn, LORD, rescue me; save me, because of your love.
\v 5 For in death none can call you to mind; in Sheol who can praise you?
\v 6 I am so weary of sighing. All the night I make my bed swim, and wet my couch with my tears.
\v 7 My eyes swollen with grief; from weeping caused by my foes.
\v 8 Begone, workers of wrong, for the LORD has heard my loud weeping,
\v 9 the LORD has heard my entreaty, the LORD accepts my prayer.
\v 10 My foes will be stricken with terror, brought to shame and dismay in a moment.

Psalm 7 – A Prayer to the God of JusticeRevision 2A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD about Cush, the Benjamite.
\v 1 LORD my God, I take refuge in you. Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;
\v 2 or like lions they will tear me to pieces, and rend me, past hope of rescue.
\v 3 LORD, my God, if my life has been suchif my hands have been stained with guilt,
\v 4 if friends I paid back with evil, if I plundered my foes without cause,
\v 5 may the enemy chase and find me, trample my life to the ground, my honor leave in the dirt! Selah
\v 6 Arise, LORD, in anger, against my foes rise in fury. Awake for my help: let justice be done.
\v 7 Gather the nations about you, and sit on your lofty throne,
\v 8 as the LORD, the judge of the peoples. Judge me, LORD, in my innocenceand according to my integrity.
\v 9 Put an end to the wrong of the wicked, protect the righteous. Searcher of hearts and minds, righteous God.
\v 10 God is my shield: he saves the upright in heart.
\v 11 God is a just judge, constant in righteous anger.
\v 12 He will sharpen his sword without fail, his bow is bent and ready,
\v 13 his deadly weapons are ready, his arrows he makes of flame.
\v 14 The enemy who conceives evil; pregnant with mischief, giving birth to lies,
\v 15 a pit they have made and dug; but into the hole that they made they will fall.
\v 16 On their own heads their mischief comes back; on their own skulls their violence comes down.
\v 17 I will give thanks to the LORD for his justice, and sing to the name of the LORD Most High.

Psalm 8 – God’s Glory in NatureRevision 2For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument.
\v 1 LORD our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name! Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,
\v 2 from the mouths of children and infants. You have built a fortressagainst your enemies, to silence the foe and the rebel.
\v 3 When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set there,
\v 4 what are mortals, that you think of them, humans, that you visit them?
\v 5 Yet you made them little less than divine, crowned them with glory and majesty,
\v 6 made them lord of the works of your hands, put all things under their feet –
\v 7 sheep and oxen, all of them; and the wild beasts also:
\v 8 birds of the air, and fish of the sea, and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.
\v 9 LORD our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name!

Psalm 9 – A Song of Praise the Lord’s JusticeRevision 2For the leader; ’almuth labben. A psalm of David.
\v 1 With all my heart I will praise the LORD, all your wonders I will rehearse.
\v 2 I will rejoice and exult in you, singing praise to your name, Most High;
\v 3 because backward my foes were turned, they stumbled and perished before you.
\v 4 My right and my claim you have upheld, you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
\v 5 rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked, and blotting their name out forever and ever.
\v 6 The foe is vanished, ruined forever, their cities destroyed, their memory perished.
\v 7 See! The LORD is seated foreveron the throne he established for judgment,
\v 8 ruling the world with justice, and judging the nations with equity.
\v 9 So the LORD proves a haven to the oppressed, a haven in times of trouble.
\v 10 Well may they trust you who know your name, for those who seek you, you never abandon.
\v 11 Sing praise to the LORD, whose home is in Zion, declare his deeds among the nations.
\v 12 As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind, he does not forget the cry of the wretched.
\v 13 Show me favor, LORD, see how my foes afflict me, lift me up from the gates of death;
\v 14 so I may, in your help exulting, tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.
\v 15 The nations are sunk in the pit which they made, in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
\v 16 The LORD is revealed in the judgment he wrought, the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. Selah
\v 17 Let the wicked depart to Sheol, all the nations that live forgetful of God.
\v 18 For the needy will not be always forgotten, nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.
\v 19 Arise, LORD; don’t let them triumph: before your face let the nations be judged.
\v 20 Strike them with fear, LORD: show the nations how frail they are. Selah
\c 10

Psalm 10 – A Prayer for HelpRevision 2
\v 1 Why do you stand, LORD, so far away, hiding yourself in times of trouble?
\v 2 The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless: let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.
\v 3 For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed; the robber despises the LORD, and curses him,
\v 4 in wicked pride, thinks: God doesn’t care, God doesn’t call to account.
\v 5 Never a season that they do not prosper; your judgments are far above out of their sight: they scoff at their foes.
\v 6 Each says in their heart, “I will never be shaken; I will live for all timeuntouched by misfortune.”
\v 7 Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression: under their tongues lurks mischief and wrong.
\v 8 Lying in secret in some village ambush, and stealthily watching, they murder the innocent.
\v 9 Like a lion that lurks in a secret lairthey lurk intending to catch the defenceless; to seize them, to drag them away in their net.
\v 10 Their victims are crushed, sink down to the ground. Under their clawsthe hapless fall.
\v 11 The wicked say in their heartsthat God has forgotten, has hidden his face, will see nothing.
\v 12 Arise, LORD, lift up your hand, do not forget the cry of the wretched.
\v 13 Why do the wicked treat God with contempt, and say in their hearts, “God doesn’t care”?
\v 14 You have seen the trouble and sorrow; you mark it all, and will take it in hand. The hapless can count on you, helper of orphans.
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil: search out their sin, till no more be found.
\v 16 The LORD is king forever and ever: the nations will vanish from his land.
\v 17 LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble, inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,
\v 18 rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan, so no one on earth may strike terror again.

Psalm 11 – Trust in the LordRevision 2For the leader. Of David.
\v 1 In the LORD I take refuge. How can you tell meto flee like a bird to the mountains?
\v 2 “See! The wicked are bending the bow, their arrow is set on the string, to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
\v 3 In this tearing down of foundationswhat good can a good person do?”
\v 4 The LORD in his holy temple, the LORD in heaven, enthroned. His eyes watch the world, they see everyone.
\v 5 The LORD examines the righteous and wicked, and the lover of violence he hates.
\v 6 On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone, and their drink will be scorching wind.
\v 7 For the LORD is just, and justice he loves; so the upright will see his face.

Psalm 12 – A Prayer for the Faithful in a False WorldRevision 2For the leader; on the sheminith. A psalm of David.
\v 1 Help, LORD, for the good are all gone, faithful people have vanished.
\v 2 One lies to another, speaking empty lies, with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.
\v 3 May the LORD cut off all the flattering lips, and the tongue that utters arrogance,
\v 4 they declare, “Our tongue is our strength, our allies our lips: who is lord over us?”
\v 5 “The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing; so now I will act,” the LORD declares“And place them in the safety they long for.”
\v 6 The words of the LORD are words that are pure, silver smelted, seven times refined.
\v 7 You will keep us, LORD, and guard us from this generation forever,
\v 8 in a world where the wicked prowl, and the worthless are exalted.
\c 13

Psalm 13 – A Prayer for Help in TroubleRevision 2For the leader. A psalm of David.
\v 1 How long, LORD, will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
\v 2 How long must I nurse grief inside me, and in my heart a daily sorrow? How long are my foes to exult over me?
\v 3 Look at me, answer me, LORD my God. Fill my eyes with your light, lest I sleep in death,
\v 4 lest my enemies claim to have triumphed, lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
\v 5 But I trust in your kindness: my heart will rejoice in your help.
\v 6 I will sing to the LORD who was good to me.

Psalm 14 – The Folly of Denying GodRevision 2For the leader. Of David.
\v 1 Fools say in their heart, “There is no God.”Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.
\v 2 From heaven the LORD looks outon humans, to seeif any are wise, and care for God.
\v 3 But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.
\v 4 Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the LORD.
\v 5 Sore afraid will they be; for God is amongthose who are righteous,
\v 6 you may mock the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge.
\v 7 If only help from Zionwould come for Israel! When the LORD brings his peoplea change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!
\c 15
\p
Psalm 15 – Standing FirmRevision 2A psalm of David.
\v 1 LORD, who can be guest in your tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?
\v 2 The person whose walk is blameless, whose conduct is right, whose words are true and sincere;
\v 3 on whose tongue there sits no slander, who will not harm a friend,
\v 4 nor cruelly insult a neighbor, who regards with contempt those rejected by God; but honors those who obey the LORD, who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
\v 5 whose money is lent without interest, and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent. The person who does these things will always stand firm.
\c 16

Psalm 16 – The Joy of Fellowship with GodRevision 2A michtam of David.
\v 1 Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
\v 2 I said to the LORD, “You are my LORD, my happiness rests in you alone.
\v 3 Those who are holy in the land, they, they alone, are the noble ones; all my delight is in them.”
\v 4 Those who choose other godsfind endless sorrow. In their offerings of blood I will have no partnor take their name on my lips.
\v 5 The LORD is my share and my portion, my fate is in your strong hands.
\v 6 The boundary lines of my lifemark out delightful country, my heritage pleases me well.
\v 7 I praise the LORD for his counsel, which so stirs my heart in the night.
\v 8 I keep the LORD always in mind: with him at my hand, I can never be moved.
\v 9 So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me; and in safety of body I live.
\v 10 For you will not give me up to Sheolnor let any who love you see the pit.
\v 11 You will show me the path that leads to life, to that fulness of joy which is in your presence, and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.

Psalm 17 – A Prayer for DeliveranceRevision 2A prayer of David.
\v 1 Listen, O LORD, to my innocence; attend to my piercing cry. Give heed to my prayerout of lips unfeigned.
\v 2 Let my vindication come from you, your eyes see the truth.
\v 3 When you test my heart when you visit at night, and assay me like silver – you can find no evil. I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
\v 4 I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
\v 5 My steps have held fast to the paths of your preceptsand in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.
\v 6 So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer; bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
\v 7 Show your marvelous love, you who save from enemiesthose who take refuge at your right hand.
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me in the shelter of your wings.
\v 9 From wicked people who do me violence, from deadly foes who crowd around me.
\v 10 They have closed their hearts to pity, the words of their mouths are haughty.
\v 11 Now they dog us at every step, keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
\v 12 like a lion, longing to tear, like a young lion, lurking in secret.
\v 13 Arise, LORD, face them and fell them. By your sword set me free from the wicked,
\v 14 by your hand, O LORD, from those –whose portion of life is but of this world. But let your treasured ones have food in plentymay their children be full and their children satisfied.
\v 15 In my innocence I will see your face, awake I am filled with a vision of you.

Psalm 18 – A King’s Song of GratitudeRevision 2For the leader. Of David, the servant of the LORD, who recited the words of this song to the LORD after the LORD had saved him from the power of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
\v 1 I love you, O LORD, my strength.
\v 2 The LORD is my rock, my fortress, deliverer, my God, my rock, where I take refuge, my shield, my defender, my tower.
\v 3 Worthy of praise is the LORD whom I call on, he rescues me from all my foes.
\v 4 The waves of death broke about me, fearful floods of chaos.
\v 5 Sheol threw cords around me, snares of death came to meet me.
\v 6 In distress I cried to the LORD, and shouted for help to my God; in his temple he heard my voice, into his ears came my cry.
\v 7 Then the earth shook and quaked, mountains trembled to their foundations, and quaked because of his wrath.
\v 8 Smoke went up from his nostrils, devouring fire from his mouth, coals were kindled by it.
\v 9 Then he bent the sky and came down, thick darkness was under his feet.
\v 10 He rode on a cherub and flew, darting on wings of wind,
\v 11 with his screen of darkness about him, in thick dark clouds of water.
\v 12 At the radiance before him there passedhailstones and coals of fire.
\v 13 The LORD thundered from heaven, the Most High uttered his voice.
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered them, flashed lightnings, and routed them.
\v 15 The channels of the sea were revealed, the world was laid bare to its base, at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
\v 16 He stretched from on high, he seized me, drew me up from the mighty waters,
\v 17 and saved me from those who hated me –fierce foes, too mighty for me.
\v 18 In my day of distress they assailed me, but the LORD proved my support.
\v 19 To a spacious place he brought me, and, for love of me, he saved me.
\v 20 The LORD repays my innocence, he rewards my cleanness of hands.
\v 21 For I kept the ways of the LORD, nor have wickedly strayed from my God.
\v 22 His commandments were all before me, his statutes I put not away.
\v 23 And I was blameless before him, guarding myself from sin.
\v 24 So the LORD repaid my innocence, my cleanness of hands in his sight.
\v 25 With the loyal you are loyal, and with the blameless blameless.
\v 26 With the pure you show yourself pure, but shrewd with the devious.
\v 27 For the lowly people you save, but haughty eyes you abase.
\v 28 You are my lamp, LORD, my God who enlightens my darkness.
\v 29 With you I can storm a rampart, with my God I can leap a wall.
\v 30 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is pure. He is shield to all who take refuge in him.
\v 31 For who is God but the LORD? And who is a rock but our God?
\v 32 The God who arms me with strength, who cleared and smoothed my way.
\v 33 He made my feet like hinds’ feet, and set me up on the heights.
\v 34 He taught my hands how to fight, and my arms how to bend a bronze bow.
\v 35 The shield of your help you gave me, your right hand supports me, you stoop down to make me great.
\v 36 In your strength I took giant strides, and my feet never slipped.
\v 37 So I chased the foe till I caught them, and turned not, till I made an end of them.
\v 38 I smashed them, they could not rise, they fell beneath my feet.
\v 39 You did arm me with strength for war, you did bow my assailants beneath me.
\v 40 You made my foes turn their back to me, and those who did hate me I finished.
\v 41 They cried for help, but none saved them; to the LORD, but he answered them not.
\v 42 I beat them like dust of the market-place, stamped them like mud of the streets.
\v 43 From the strife of the peoples you saved me, you made me head of the nations, peoples I knew not did serve me.
\v 44 On the instant they hear, they obey me, foreigners come to me cringing.
\v 45 Foreigners lose courage, and come out of their strongholds trembling.
\v 46 The LORD is alive! Blest be my rock! Exalted be God, my protector!
\v 47 The God who gave me revenge, and brought down nations beneath me,
\v 48 who saved me from angry foes, and set me above my assailants, safe from the violent.
\v 49 For this I will praise you among the nations, making music, O LORD, to your name:
\v 50 for great triumphs he grants to his king, and faithful love he shows his anointed, to David and his seed evermore.

Psalm 19 – The Glory of God in the HeavensRevision 2For the leader. A psalm of David.
\v 1 The heavens declare God’s glory, the sky tells what his hands have done.
\v 2 Day tells it to day, night reveals it to night,
\v 3 without speaking, without words; without the sound of voices.
\v 4 But through all the world their voice carriestheir words to the ends of the earth. He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky,
\v 5 it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber, it joyfully runs its course like a hero.
\v 6 From one end of the heavens it rises, and around it runs to the other, and nothing hides from its heat. In Praise of the Law
\v 7 The law of the LORD is perfect, renewing life. The decrees of the LORD are trusty, making the simple wise.
\v 8 The behests of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart. The command of the LORD is pure, giving light to the eyes.
\v 9 Respect for the LORD is clean, it endures forever. The LORD’s judgments are trueand right altogether.
\v 10 More precious are they than gold –than fine gold in plenty, and sweeter they are than honey, that drops from the comb.
\v 11 By them is your servant warned; who keeps them has rich reward.
\v 12 Who can know their flaws? Absolve me from those I know not.
\v 13 Keep your servant from wilful sins –from falling under their sway: then blameless and clear will I befrom great offense.
\v 14 May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heartbe pleasing to you, LORD, my rock and redeemer.

\v 1 The LORD answer you in the day of distress, the name of the Jacob’s God protect you,
\v 2 sending you help from the temple, out of Zion supporting you.
\v 3 All your meal-offerings may he remember, your burnt-offerings look on with favor. Selah
\v 4 May he grant you your heart’s desire, and bring all your plans to pass.
\v 5 We will shout then for joy at your victory, and rejoice in the name of our God. May the LORD grant your every request.
\v 6 Now I am sure that the LORDwill help his anointed. From his temple in heaven he will answerby his mighty triumphant right hand.
\v 7 Some in chariots are strong, some in horses; but our strength is the LORD our God.
\v 8 They will totter and fall, while we rise and stand firm.
\v 9 Give victory, LORD, to the king, and answer us when we call.

Psalm 21 – A Prayer after a VictoryRevision 2For the leader. A psalm of David.
\v 1 The king rejoices, LORD, in your might, how he exults because of your help!
\v 2 You have granted to him his heart’s desire, you have not withheld his lips’ request. Selah
\v 3 You came to meet him with rich blessings, you set on his head a golden crown.
\v 4 He asked you for life, you gave it –many long days, forever and ever.
\v 5 Great is his glory because of your help, honor and majesty you lay upon him.
\v 6 For you make him most blessed forever, you make him glad with the joy of your presence.
\v 7 For the king puts always his trust in the LORD; the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken.
\v 8 Your hand will reach all your foes, your right hand, all who hate you.
\v 9 You will make them like a furnace of fire, when you appear, LORD. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire will devour them.
\v 10 You will sweep their offspring from the earth, their children from humanity.
\v 11 When they scheme against youand hatch evil plots – they will fail.
\v 12 For you aim your bow at their faces, make them turn in flight.
\v 13 Be exalted, LORD, in your strength, to your might we shall sing and make music.

Psalm 22 – The Sufferer’s TriumphFor the leader; set to ‘Deer of the Dawn’. A psalm of David.
\v 1 My God, my God, why have you left me, my rescue so far from the words of my roaring?
\v 2 I cry in the day, you do not answer, I cry in the night but find no rest.
\v 3 You are the Holy One, throned on the praises of Israel.
\v 4 In you our ancestors trusted, they trusted and you delivered them.
\v 5 They cried to you, and found safety, in you did they trust and were not put to shame.
\v 6 But I am a worm, not a person; insulted by others, despised by the people.
\v 7 All who see me mock me, with mouths wide open and wagging heads:
\v 8 “He relies on the LORD; let him save him. Let him rescue the one he holds dear!”
\v 9 But you drew me from the womb, laid me safely on my mother’s breasts.
\v 10 On your care was I cast from my very birth, you are my God from my mother’s womb.
\v 11 Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh, and there is none to help.
\v 12 I am circled by many bulls, beset by the mighty of Bashan,
\v 13 who face me with gaping jaws, like ravening roaring lions.
\v 14 Poured out am I like water, and all my bones are loosened. My heart is become like wax, melted within me.
\v 15 My palate is dry as a sherd, my tongue sticks to my jaws; in the dust of death you lay me.
\v 16 For dogs are round about me, a band of knaves encircles me, gnawing my hands and my feet.
\v 17 I can count my bones, every one. As for them, they feast their eyes on me.
\v 18 They divide my garments among them, and over my raiment cast lots.
\v 19 But you, O LORD, be not far, O my strength, hasten to help me.
\v 20 Deliver my life from the swordmy life from the power of the dogs.
\v 21 Save me from the jaws of the lion, from the horns of the wild oxen help me.
\v 22 I will tell of your fame to my kindred, and in the assembly will praise you.
\v 23 Praise the LORD, you who revere him. All Jacob’s seed, give him glory. All Israel’s seed, stand in awe of him.
\v 24 For he has not despised nor abhorredthe sorrow of the sorrowful. He hid not his face from me, but he listened to my cry for help.
\v 25 Of you is my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will pay before those who revere him.
\v 26 The afflicted will eat to their heart’s desire, and those who seek after the LORD will praise him. Lift up your hearts forever.
\v 27 All will call it to mind, to the ends of the earth, and turn to the LORD; and all tribes of the nations will bow down before you.
\v 28 For the kingdom belongs to the LORD: he is the LORD of the nations.
\v 29 To him will bow down all who sleep in the earth, and before him bend all who go down to the dust, and those who could not preserve their lives.
\v 30 My descendants will tell of the LORDto the next generation;
\v 31 they will declare his righteousnessto people yet to be born: He has done it.

Psalm 23 – The Good ShepherdRevision 2A psalm of David.
\v 1 The LORD is my shepherd: I am never in need.
\v 2 He lays me down in green pastures. He gently leads me to waters of rest,

\v 4 And when my way lies through a valley of gloom, I fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff comfort me.

\v 6 Surely goodness and love will pursue me –all the days of my life. In the house of the LORD I will livethrough the length of the days.

Psalm 24 – The True WorshipperOf David. A psalm.
\v 1 The earth is the LORD’s and all that it holds, the world and those who live in it.
\v 2 For he founded it on the seas, and on the floods he sustains it.
\v 3 Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place?
\v 4 The clean of hands, the pure of heart, who sets not their heart upon sinful things, nor swears with intent to deceive:
\v 5 they win from the LORD a blessing: God is their champion and savior.
\v 6 Such must be those who resort to him, and seek the face of the God of Jacob. SelahThe Lords’s Triumphal Entry into the Sanctuary

Psalm 25 – A Prayer for Forgiveness and ProtectionA psalm of David.
\v 1 To you, O LORD, I lift up my heart: all the day I wait for you.
\v 2 In you I trust, put me not to shame; let not my foes exult over me.

\v 4 Make me, O LORD, to know your ways: teach me your paths.
\v 5 In your faithfulness guide me and teach me, for you are my God and my savior.
\v 6 Remember your pity, O LORD, and your kindness, for they have been ever of old.
\v 7 Do not remember the sins of my youth; remember me in kindness, because of your goodness, LORD.
\v 8 Good is the LORD and upright, so he teaches sinners the way.
\v 9 The humble he guides in the right, he teaches the humble his way.
\v 10 All his ways are loving and loyalto those who observe his charges and covenant.
\v 11 Be true to your name LORD, forgive my many sins.
\v 12 Who then is the person who honors the LORD? He will teach them the way to choose.
\v 13 They will live in prosperity, their children will inherit the land.

\v 18 Look on my misery and trouble, and pardon all my sins,
\v 19 look on my foes oh, so many! And their cruel hatred towards me.
\v 20 Deliver me, keep me, and shame notone who takes refuge in you.
\v 21 May integrity and innocence preserve me, for I wait for you, O LORD.

Psalm 26 – Prayer of a Devout WorshipperA psalm of David.
\v 1 Defend me, O LORD, for my walk has been blameless; in the LORD have I trusted unswervingly:
\v 2 Examine me, LORD, and test me; test my heart and my mind.
\v 3 For your love is before my eyes, and your faithfulness governs my way.
\v 4 I never sat down with the worthless, nor companied with dissemblers.
\v 5 I hate the assembly of knaves, I would never sit down with the wicked;
\v 6 but, with hands washed in innocence, I would march round your altar, O LORD,
\v 7 singing loud songs of thanks, and telling of all your wonders.
\v 8 O LORD, I love your house, the place where your glory lives.
\v 9 Do not gather me up with sinners; slay me not with people of blood,
\v 10 whose hands are stained with villainy, and whose right hand is filled with bribes.
\v 11 But my walk is blameless! O redeem me, be gracious to me.
\v 12 My foot stands on even ground, in the choirs I will bless the LORD.

Psalm 27 – If God is for MeA psalm of David.
\v 1 The LORD is my light and my savior; whom then should I fear? The LORD protects my life; whom then should I dread?
\v 2 When the wicked drew near to assail meand eat up my flesh, it was those who distressed and opposed mewho stumbled and fell.
\v 3 Though against me a host should encamp, yet my heart would be fearless: though battle should rise up against me, still would I be trustful.
\v 4 One thing have I asked of the LORD, and that do I long for –To live in the house of the LORDall the days of my life, to gaze on the grace of the LORDand inquire in his temple.
\v 5 For he will hide me in his shelterin the day of misfortune. In his sheltering tent he hides me: he lifts me up on a rock.
\v 6 And now that my head he has liftedabove my encircling foes, I will march round the altar and sacrifice, shouting with joy, in his tent, making music and song to the LORD. The Serenity of Faith
\v 7 Hear, O LORD, my loud cry, and graciously answer me.
\v 8 My heart has said to you, “Your face, O LORD, I seek.”
\v 9 Hide not your face from me, reject not your servant in anger: for you have been my help. Abandon me not, nor forsake me, O God of my help:
\v 10 for father and mother have left me; but the LORD will take me up.
\v 11 Teach me your way, O LORD: lead me in an even path, because of my enemies.
\v 12 Give me not up, O LORD, unto the rage of my foes; for against me have risen false witnesses, breathing out cruelty.
\v 13 Firm is the faith I cherish, that I, in the land of the living, will yet see the goodness of God.
\v 14 Let your heart be courageous and strong, and wait on the LORD.

Psalm 28 – An Answered Prayer for HelpOf David.
\v 1 Unto you, O LORD, do I cry; my rock, be not deaf to me: lest, through holding your peace, I becomelike those who go down to the pit.
\v 2 Hear my loud entreaty, as I cry for help to you, lifting my hands, O LORD, towards your holy chancel.
\v 3 Take me not off with the wicked, nor with the workers of wrong, whose speech to their neighbors is friendly, while evil is in their heart.
\v 4 Give them as they have done, as their wicked deeds deserve. As their hands have wrought, so give to them: requite to them their deserts.
\v 5 They are blind to all that the LORD does, to all that his hands have wrought; and so he will tear them down, to build them up no more.
\v 6 Blest be the LORD, who has heardmy voice as I plead for mercy.
\v 7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him. I was helped: so my heart is exultant, and in my song I will praise him.
\v 8 The LORD is the strength of his people, the fortress who saves his anointed.
\v 9 O save your people, and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherdand carry them forever.

\v 1 Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and power
\v 2 Ascribe to the LORD the glory he manifests: bow to the LORD in holy array.
\v 3 The LORD’s voice peals on the waters. The God of glory has thundered. He peals o’er the mighty waters.
\v 4 The LORD’s voice sounds with strength, the LORD’s voice sounds with majesty.
\v 5 The LORD’s voice breaks the cedars, he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
\v 6 making Lebanon dance like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox.
\v 7 The LORD’s voice hews out flames of fire.
\v 8 The LORD’s voice rends the desert, he rends the desert of Kadesh.
\v 9 The LORD’s voice whirls the oaks, and strips the forests bare; and all in his temple say “Glory.”
\v 10 The LORD was king at the flood, the LORD sits throned forever.
\v 11 The LORD gives strength to his people, he blesses his people with peace.

Psalm 30 – A Song of Thanksgiving for DeliveranceA psalm of David. A song for the dedication of the Temple.
\v 1 I will extol you, O LORD, because you have lifted me up, and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.
\v 2 I cried to you for help, O LORD my God, and you healed me.
\v 3 You have brought me up, LORD, from Sheol, from my way to the pit back to life you have called me.
\v 4 Sing praise to the LORD, faithful people; give thanks to his holy name.
\v 5 For his anger lasts only a moment, his favor endures for a lifetime. Weeping may lodge for the night, but the morning brings shouts of joy.
\v 6 When all went well, I imaginedthat never should I be shaken.
\v 7 For by your favor, O LORD, you had set me on mountains strong: but you hide your face, and I was confounded.
\v 8 Then to you, LORD, I cried, to the LORD I begged for mercy,
\v 9 “What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Can you be praised by dust? Can it tell of your faithfulness?
\v 10 Hear, LORD, and show me your favor, LORD be a helper to me.”
\v 11 You have turned my mourning to dancing; my sackcloth you have unloosed, and clothed me with joy:
\v 12 that unceasingly I should sing your praise, and give thanks to you, LORD my God, forever.

Psalm 31 – A Prayer for Deliverance from TroublesFor the leader. A psalm of David.
\v 1 In you, O LORD, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame. Rescue me in your faithfulness;
\v 2 incline to me your ear. Deliver me speedily. Be to me a rock of defence, a fortified house, to save me.
\v 3 For my rock and my fortress are you; lead me and guide me so your name will be honored.
\v 4 Draw me out of the net they have hid for me, for you yourself are my refuge.
\v 5 Into your hand I commend my spirit: you ransom me, LORD, faithful God.
\v 6 I hate those devoted to worthless idols; I trust in the LORD.
\v 7 I will rejoice and be glad in your love, because you have looked on my misery, and cared for me in my distress.
\v 8 You have not given me into the enemy’s hand, you have set my feet in a spacious place.
\v 9 Be gracious to me, LORD, for I am distressed; my eye is wasted away with sorrow.
\v 10 For my life is consumed with grief, and my years with sighing. My strength is broken with misery, my bones waste away.
\v 11 The scorn of all my foes, the butt of my neighbors am I, a terror to my acquaintance. At the sight of me in the streetpeople turn quickly away.
\v 12 I am clean forgotten like the dead, am become like a ruined vessel.
\v 13 I hear the whispers of many –terror on every side –scheming together against me, plotting to take my life.
\v 14 But my trust is in you, LORD. “You are my God,” I say;
\v 15 my times are in your hand, save mefrom the hand of the foes who pursue me.
\v 16 Make your face to shine on your servant, save me in your love.
\v 17 Put me not, O LORD, to shame, for I have called upon you. Let the wicked be put to shamesilent in Sheol.
\v 18 Strike the false lips dumb, that speak proudly against the righteouswith haughtiness and contempt.
\v 19 How great is the goodnessyou have treasured for those who revere you, and wrought for those who take refuge in you, in plain sight of all!
\v 20 In your sheltering wings you hide themfrom plottings of people, you keep them safe in a bowerfrom the chiding of tongues.
\v 21 Blest be the LORDfor the wonderful love he has shown mein time of distress.
\v 22 For I had said in panic, “I am driven clean out of your sight.”But you heard my plea, when I cried to you for help.
\v 23 Love the LORD, all you faithful; the LORD protects the loyal, but repays the haughty in full.
\v 24 Let your hearts be courageous and strong, all you who wait on the LORD.

Psalm 32 – A Prayer of Confession and JoyOf David. A maskil.
\v 1 Happy those whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.
\v 2 Happy are those, free from falseness of spirit, to whom the LORD reckons no debt of guilt.
\v 3 When I held my peace, my bones wore awaywith my endless groaning;
\v 4 for day and night did your handlie heavy upon me. The sap of my life was dried upas with fierce summer-heat. Selah
\v 5 I began to acknowledge my sin, not concealing my guilt; and the moment I vowed to confessto the LORD my transgression, then you yourself did pardonthe guilt of my sin. Selah
\v 6 For this cause let all who are faithfulpray to you in the time of distress; then, when the great waters rush, they will not reach to him.
\v 7 For you are my shelter, you protect me from trouble, and surround me with deliverance. Selah
\v 8 “With my eye steadfastly upon you, I will instruct and teach youThe way you should go.
\v 9 Do not be like the horse or the mule, that have no understanding, but need bridle and halter to curb them, else they will not come near to you.”
\v 10 The godless have many sorrows, but those who trust in the LORDwill be compassed about by his kindness.
\v 11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous; and ring out your joy, all you upright in heart.
\c 33
\p
Psalm 33 – A Hymn of Thanksgiving
\v 1 Shout for joy in the LORD, you righteous: praise for the upright is seemly.
\v 2 Give thanks to the LORD on the lyre, play to him on a ten-stringed harp.
\v 3 Sing to him a new song, play skilfully and shout merrily.
\v 4 For the LORD is straight in his promise; and all that he does is in faithfulness.
\v 5 Justice and right he loves; the earth is full of his kindness.
\v 6 By his word the heavens were made, all their host by the breath of his mouth.
\v 7 He gathers the sea in a bottle, the ocean he puts into store-houses.
\v 8 Let the whole world honor the LORD, let all who live on earth be in awe.
\v 9 For at his word it came into being, at his command it stood forth.
\v 10 The LORD frustrates the designs of the nations, what the peoples have purposed, he brings to nought,
\v 11 but the LORD’s own design will stand forever, and what his heart has purposed, through all generations.
\v 12 Happy the nation whose God is the LORD, the people he chose for himself as his own.
\v 13 The LORD looks down from heaven, he sees all of humanity;
\v 14 from where he rules he gazeson all who inhabit the earth.
\v 15 He fashions the hearts of them all, and gives heed to all that they do.
\v 16 It is not by great armies that kings are victorious, it is not by great strength that a warrior saves himself;
\v 17 false hope is the war-horse to usher in victory, for all its great might it can provide no escape.
\v 18 See! The eye of the LORD is on those who revere him, on those who hope in his kindness;
\v 19 to deliver their life from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
\v 20 We wait for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
\v 21 For in him our heart is glad, we trust in his holy name.
\v 22 Let your kindness, O LORD, be upon us, as is our hope in you.

Psalm 34 – The Lord is Mindful of His OwnOf David, when he feigned madness in the presence of Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left.
\v 1 I will bless the LORD at all times, in my mouth will his praise be forever.
\v 2 In the LORD will my heart make her boast, the humble will hear and be glad.
\v 3 O magnify the LORD with meand let us extol his name together.
\v 4 I sought the LORD, and, in answer, he saved me from all my terrors.
\v 5 Look to him and you will be radiant, with faces unashamed.
\v 6 Here is one who was crushed, but cried and was heard by the LORD, and brought safe out of every trouble.
\v 7 The LORD’s angel encampsabout those who revere him, and rescues them.
\v 8 O taste and see that the LORD is good, happy those who take refuge in him.
\v 9 Honor the LORD, all his people, for they who revere him lack nothing.
\v 10 Even young lions may be poor and hungry, but those who seek the LORDwill not lack any good thing.
\v 11 Come, children, listen to me. I will teach you to honor the LORD.
\v 12 Which of you is desirous of life, loves many and happy days?
\v 13 Then guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit.
\v 14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
\v 15 The eyes of the LORD are towards the righteous, his ears are towards their cry for help.
\v 16 The LORD sets his face against those who do evil, to root their memory out of the earth.
\v 17 When righteous cry, they are heard by the LORD, and he saves them from all their distresses.
\v 18 The LORD is near to the broken-hearted, he helps those whose spirit is crushed.
\v 19 Many misfortunes befall the righteous, but the LORD delivers them out of them all.
\v 20 He guards all their bones, none are broken.
\v 21 Misfortune will slay the ungodly; those who hate the righteous are doomed.
\v 22 The LORD ransoms the life of his servants, and none will be doomed who takes refuge in him.

Psalm 35 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious FoesOf David.
\v 1 Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me, do battle with those who do battle with me.
\v 2 Grasp shield and buckler, and rise up as my help.
\v 3 Draw spear and battle-axe, confront those who pursue me. Assure me that you will help me.
\v 4 Dishonor and shame be on thosewho are seeking my life! Defeat and confusion on thosewho are planning my hurt!
\v 5 As chaff before wind may they be, with the LORD’s angel pursuing them.
\v 6 Slippery and dark be their way, with his angel thrusting them on.
\v 7 For they wantonly hid their net for me, and dug a pit to destroy me.
\v 8 Upon them may ruin come unawares; may the net which they hid catch themselves, and into the pit may they fall.
\v 9 Then I will exult in the LORD, and be joyful because of his help;
\v 10 and all my being will say, “Who, O LORD, is like you, who save the helpless from those too strong for them, the poor and the helpless from those who despoil them?”
\v 11 Violent witnesses rise, and ask of me things that I know not.
\v 12 Evil for good they requite me, leaving me inwardly comfortless.
\v 13 But when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and chastened myself with fasting. I prayed with head bowed low,
\v 14 as if for my friend or my brother. I went about bowed and in mourning, as one who laments his mother.
\v 15 When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered, strangers gathered around me, and tore at me without ceasing,
\v 16 impiously mocking and mocking, bearing their teeth at me.
\v 17 How long, LORD, will you look on? Rescue me from their roaring, my precious life from the lions.
\v 18 I will then give you thanks in the great congregation, and praise you before many people.
\v 19 Suffer not those to rejoice over mewho are falsely my foes, suffer not those who without cause abhor meto wink with the eye.
\v 20 For it is not peace that they speakof those who are quiet in the land; but treacherous charges they plot.
\v 21 With wide open mouths they shout, “Hurrah! Hurrah! With our own eyes we saw it.”
\v 22 But you have seen, too, O LORD, keep not silence, O LORD, be not far from me.
\v 23 Bestir you, awake, for my rightmy God, my LORD, for my cause.
\v 24 You are just, LORD: win for me justice, let them not rejoice over me,
\v 25 inwardly saying, “Hurrah! The desire of our hearts at last! Now we have swallowed him up.”
\v 26 Shame and confusion togetheron those who rejoice at my hurt! Clothed with shame and dishonorbe those who are haughty to me!
\v 27 Let such as delight in my causering out their gladness, and say evermore, “Great is the LORD whose delightis the well-being of his servant.”
\v 28 Then my tongue will tell of your justice, and all the day long of your praise.

Psalm 36 – The Triumphant Power of God’s LoveFor the leader. Of the servant of the LORD, of David.
\v 1 Sin whispers within the heart of the wicked, no respect for God shows in their eyes.
\v 2 It flatters them in their eyesthat their sin will not be found out.
\v 3 First, their speech becomes wicked and false, they give up acting wisely and well.
\v 4 Then they plot deliberate wrong, take their stand on the wicked way, without the least shrinking from evil.
\v 5 Your love, O LORD, touches the heavens, your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
\v 6 Your justice is like the great mountains, your judgments are like the broad sea. LORD, you save people and animals.
\v 7 How precious your love, O God! All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.
\v 8 They feast on the fat of your house, they drink of your brook of delights.
\v 9 For with you is the fountain of life, in the light that is yours we see light.
\v 10 O continue your grace to the faithful, your love to the upright in heart.
\v 11 Let no arrogant foot tread upon me, no wicked hand drive me to exile.
\v 12 There the workers of wrong lie prostrate, thrust down to rise up no more.

Psalm 37 – Trust in the Lord and Do GoodOf David.
\v 1 Be not kindled to wrath at the wicked, nor envious of those who work wrong;
\v 2 for, like grass, they will speedily wither, and fade like the green of young grass.
\v 3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; remain in the land, and deal faithfully:
\v 4 then the LORD will be your delight, he will grant you your heart’s petitions.
\v 5 Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act,
\v 6 making clear as the light your right, and your just cause clear as the noon-day.
\v 7 In silence and patience wait on the LORD. Be not kindled to anger at those who prosper. At those who execute evil devices.
\v 8 Desist from anger, abandon wrath: be not kindled to anger it leads but to evil:
\v 9 for evildoers will be cut off, but the land will be theirs, who wait on the LORD.
\v 10 Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish: look at their place: they are there no more.
\v 11 But the humble will have the land, and the rapture of peace in abundance.
\v 12 The wicked plots against the righteous, snarls like a wild animal;
\v 13 the LORD laughs, for he sees that his day is coming.
\v 14 The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow, to fell the poor, to slay those who walk uprightly;
\v 15 but their sword will pierce their own heart, and their bows will be broken in pieces.
\v 16 Better is the righteous person’s littlethan the wealth of many wicked.
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.
\v 18 The LORD watches over the days of the blameless, their heritage will continue forever.
\v 19 They will not be shamed in the evil time, in the days of famine they will be satisfied.
\v 20 Because the wicked will perish: but the foes of the LORD, like a brand in the oven, will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.
\v 21 The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back, but the righteous is lavish and gives.
\v 22 For those blest by the LORD inherit the land, while those whom he curses will be cut off.
\v 23 The LORD supports the stepsof those with whom he is pleased.
\v 24 Though they fall, they will not be cast headlong, for the LORD holds their hands.
\v 25 Never, from youth to age, have I seen the righteous forsaken, or their children begging bread.
\v 26 They are ever lavishly lending, and their children are fountains of blessing.
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do goodand you will live in the land forever.
\v 28 For the LORD loves justice, he does not forsake his friends. The unrighteous will be destroyed forever, and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
\v 29 But the land will belong to the righteous, they will live upon it forever,
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom, and words of justice are on their tongues.
\v 31 The law of their God is in their heart, their steps are never unsteady.
\v 32 The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to put them to death.
\v 33 But the LORD leaves them not in their hand: at their trial they will not be held guilty.
\v 34 Wait on the LORD, and observe his way: he will lift you to honor the land will be yours, you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.
\v 35 I have seen the wicked exultant, lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon.
\v 36 But the moment I passed, they vanished! I sought for them, but they could not be found.
\v 37 Preserve your honor and practise uprightness, for such a person fares well in the end.
\v 38 But transgressors will perish together. Cut off are the wicked forever.
\v 39 The righteous are saved by the LORD, who in time of distress is their refuge:
\v 40 the LORD helps and rescue them, from the wicked he rescues and saves them, because they take refuge in him.

Psalm 38 – A Confession and Prayer for DeliveranceA Psalm of David. A lament.
\v 1 Reprove me not, LORD, in your anger, and chasten me not in your wrath;
\v 2 for your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand lies heavy upon me.
\v 3 In my flesh is no soundnessbecause of your anger, no health in my bones, because of my sin.
\v 4 For that my guiltis gone over my head: it weighs like a burdentoo heavy for me.
\v 5 My wounds stink and fester, for my foolishness I am tormented.
\v 6 Bent and bowed am I utterly, all the day going in mourning.
\v 7 My loins are filled with burning, and in my flesh is no soundness.
\v 8 I am utterly crushed and numb; I cry louder than lion roars.
\v 9 LORD, you know all that I long for, my groans are not hidden from you.
\v 10 My heart is throbbing, my strength has failed me. The light of my eyes –even it is gone from me.
\v 11 My dear ones and friends keep aloof, and my neighbors stand afar off.
\v 12 They who aim at my life lay their snares, they who seek my hurt speak of ruin, nursing treachery all the day long.
\v 13 But I turn a deaf ear and hear not; like the dumb I open not my mouth.
\v 14 I am like one without hearing, with no arguments in my mouth.
\v 15 For my hope, O LORD, is in you. You will answer, O LORD my God,
\v 16 when I utter the hope that thosewho made scorn of my tottering feetmay not rejoice over me.
\v 17 For I am ready to fall, my pain forsakes me never.
\v 18 I acknowledge my guilt, I am anxious because of my sin:
\v 19 My wanton assailants are strong, those who wrongfully hate me are many,
\v 20 who render me evil for good, and oppose me, because I make good my goal.
\v 21 Do not forsake me, O LORD; my God, be not far from me.
\v 22 Hasten to help me, O LORD my savior.

Psalm 39 – The Pathos of LifeFor the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
\v 1 I vowed to watch my words, and sin not with my tongue, but to put on my mouth a muzzle, while the wicked were in my presence.
\v 2 I was silent and dumb, speechless: but my pain was stirred up.
\v 3 My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, the fire was kindled, till at last the words came to my tongue.
\v 4 “Teach me, O LORD, my end, and the sum of my days what it is. Let me know how transient I am.
\v 5 See! My days you have made but a span, and my life is as nothing before you. It is but as a breath that everyone stands: Selah
\v 6 it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro, and all our noise is for nothing. We heap up, and know not who will gather.”
\v 7 And now, what wait I for, LORD? My hope is in you.
\v 8 From all my transgressions deliver me; make me not the scorn of the fool.
\v 9 I am dumb, never opening my mouth, for this is your own doing.
\v 10 Remove your stroke from off me: by the might of your hand I am spent.
\v 11 When you rebuke someone to punish their sins, you consume, like a moth, what they tresure. Everyone is only a breath. Selah
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O LORD; attend to my cry for help. Hold not your peace at my tears. For I am but a guest of yours, a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.
\v 13 Look away from me, let me smile again, before I die and am gone.

Psalm 40 – Thanksgiving and PetitionFor the leader. A psalm of David.
\v 1 For the LORD I waited and waited, till, inclining to me, he heard my cry.
\v 2 From the horrible pit he drew me, up out of the miry clay; he set my feet on a rock, and my steps he made firm.
\v 3 He put a new song in my mouth, of praise to our God. Many see it, and, filled with awe, put their trust in the LORD.
\v 4 Happy the person who has putin the LORD their trust, not looking to false godsor turning to idols.
\v 5 With us you have wrought in rich measure, O LORD our God, your marvels and purposes for us –none may compare with you –were I to declare or to tell them, past counting are they.
\v 6 In offerings bloody or bloodlessyou have no delight, but with open ears you have made me. Burnt-offering and offering for sinare not what you ask.
\v 7 Then said I, “Here I am, as the roll of the book has enjoined.
\v 8 My delight, O God, is to do your will, and your law is within my heart.”
\v 9 Well, O LORD, you knowthat, with lips unrestrained, your righteousness I toldin the great congregation,
\v 10 not hiding it in my heart. I have told of your steadfast help, from the great congregation I hid notyour love and your faithfulness.
\v 11 So do not restrain, LORD, your pity from us. Your love and your faithfulness – evermay they be our shield.
\v 12 For evils that cannot be numberedhave compassed me round. My transgressions have followed me up –I can bear it no more. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has forsaken me.
\v 13 O LORD, be pleased to deliver me, haste to my help, O LORD.
\v 14 May those who are seeking my lifebe ashamed and confounded together; may those who delight in my hurtbe defeated and brought to dishonor.
\v 15 May those who hurrah over mebe dumbfounded because of their shame.
\v 16 But may all who seek after yourejoice and be glad in you. May all those eager for your aid, say, “Great is the LORD” evermore.
\v 17 I am weak and needy, yet the LORD cares for me. You are my help and deliverer; don’t delay, my God.

Psalm 41 – A Prayer for Healing and VindicationFor the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
\v 1 Happy are those who consider the weak; in the day of misfortune the LORD will deliver them.
\v 2 He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land, and not give them up to the rage of their foes.
\v 3 The LORD will sustain them on bed of languishing; tending their sickness, as long as they lie.
\v 4 For this cause I say, “LORD, show me your favor; heal me, because I have sinned against you.”
\v 5 My enemies speak of me nothing but evil, “When will he die, and his name pass away?”
\v 6 When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow; their heart keeps gathering mischief the while; and when they go out, they give it speech.
\v 7 In secret they whisper together against me, all those who hate me plot evil against me.
\v 8 “Some fatal disease has fastened upon him; and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.”
\v 9 My most trusted friend, on whom I relied, who ate of my bread, has turned against me.
\v 10 But do you, LORD, graciously raise me up, that I may pay them their due reward.
\v 11 By this will I know you delight in me: if my foes may not shout over me in triumph.
\v 12 For my innocence you uphold me, and set me forever before your face.
\v 13 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,from everlasting to everlasting,Amen and Amen.

Book TwoPsalm 42 – Yearning for GodRevision 2For the leader. A maskil of the Korahites.
\v 1 Like the hart which longsfor brooks of water, I longfor you, God.
\v 2 I thirst for God, for my living God. When shall I enter in, and see the face of God?
\v 3 My tears have been my foodby day and by night; for they say to me all the day long, “Where is your God?”
\v 4 My heart floods with sorrow, as I call to mind: how I used to pass on with the throng, at their head, to the house of God, with glad shouts and giving of thanks, in the throng who kept festival.
\v 5 Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.
\v 6 I am sunk in my misery; I will therefore call you to mindfrom the land of Jordan and Hermon, the mountain Mizar.
\v 7 Flood is calling to floodat the noise of your cataracts; all your waves and your breakershave passed over me.
\v 8 In the day I cry to the LORDto summon his kindness; and the song that I sing in the nightis a prayer to the living God.
\v 9 I say to God my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk so sadly, so hard pressed by the foe?”
\v 10 It pierces me to the heartto hear the enemy’s taunts, as all the day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”
\v 11 Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.

Psalm 43 – Plea for Help
\v 1 Right me, defend my causeagainst a pitiless people. From the crafty and crooked, O God, deliver me.

\v 3 Send forth your light and your truth, let them be my guides: to your holy hill let them bring me, to the place where you live.
\v 4 Then will I go to God’s altar, to God my rejoicing; and with joy on the lyre I will praise you, O God, my God.
\v 5 Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.

Psalm 44 – A Lament in DefeatFor the leader. Of the Korahites. A maskil.
\v 1 O God, we have heard with our ears, all our ancestors have told usof the work that you wrought in their day, your wonders in days of old,
\v 2 uprooting and crushing the nations, then planting and settling them. For it wasn’t their own sword that won them the land,
\v 3 it was not their own arm that brought them the victory. Yours was the hand and the arm, yours was the face that shone on them with favor.
\v 4 It was you, my king and my God, that ordained the victories of Jacob.
\v 5 Through you we can thrust back our foes, and by your name tread down our assailants:
\v 6 for not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword win me the victory.
\v 7 Our victory comes from you, and confusion to those who hate us.
\v 8 In God we boast all the day long, and your name will we praise forever. Selah
\v 9 Yet you have spurned and disgraced us, in not going forth with our armies,
\v 10 and in making us flee from the foe, so that those who hated us plundered us.
\v 11 You have let us be eaten like sheep, you have scattered us over the world,
\v 12 sold your people for a pittance, and getting no gain from their price.
\v 13 You have made us the butt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of all round us.
\v 14 O’er the world you have made us a byword, the nations at us shake their heads.
\v 15 My disgrace is forever before me, my face is covered with shame,
\v 16 at the words of blasphemer and scoffer, at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.
\v 17 All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten younor falsely dealt with your covenant.
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back, nor our steps declined from your way,
\v 19 that you thus should have crushed us down, and covered us over with gloom, in the place where the jackals roam.
\v 20 Had we forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,
\v 21 would God not have searched this out? For he knows the heart and its secrets.
\v 22 But in your cause it is we are killed all the day, and counted as sheep for the slaughter.
\v 23 Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord? Awake, cast us not off forever.
\v 24 Why do you hide your face, forgetting our stress and our misery?
\v 25 For we have sunk down to the dust, our bodies cling to the ground.
\v 26 Arise, come to our help: for your love’s sake, ransom us.

Psalm 45 – Song for the Marriage of a KingFor the leader; on shoshannim. Of the Korahites. A maskil. A love song.
\v 1 My heart is astir with beautiful words: I will sing a song, concerning the king, with tongue like the pen of a ready writer.
\v 2 Your beauty is more than mortal, grace is shed over your lips: therefore God has blessed you forever.
\v 3 Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh. What glory and splendor!
\v 4 Good fortune attend you, as forth you ridein the cause of good faith, and as champion of justice. May your arm instruct you in deeds of dread.
\v 5 Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you: pierced to the heart are the foes of the king.
\v 6 Your throne shall endure for ever and everyour royal sceptre a sceptre of equity.
\v 7 Right you love and wrong you hate: therefore the LORD your God anoints youWith oil of gladness above your fellows.
\v 8 With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are all fragrant, you are gladdened by music of ivory harps.
\v 9 King’s daughters stand ready with jewels for you, at your right hand the queen in gold of Ophir.
\v 10 Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear: forget your folk and your father’s house.
\v 11 And when the king desires your beauty, bow to him, for he is your lord.
\v 12 So shall the Tyrians come with gifts, and the richest of people will do you homage.
\v 13 The king’s daughter is glorious altogether, with dress of pearls inwrought with gold.
\v 14 In many-coloured robes she is led to the king, with the virgin companions she brought in her train.
\v 15 The king’s palace they enter with joy and rejoicing.
\v 16 May sons of yours take the place of your fathers, whom you will make princes in all the land.
\v 17 Your name will I celebrate world without end, so that nations shall praise you for ever and ever.

Psalm 46 – Our God is a Mighty FortressFor the leader. Of the Korahites, on alamoth. A song.
\v 1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
\v 2 So we have no fear, though earth should change, and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
\v 3 Let its waters roar and foam, let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. On our side is the LORD of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. Selah
\v 4 A river there is, whose streams make gladGod’s city, the home the Most High has hallowed.
\v 5 God is within her: she cannot be shaken. God helps her at the turn of the morning.
\v 6 Nations roared, kingdoms tottered: he uttered his voice, earth melted away.
\v 7 On our side is the LORD of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob.
\v 8 Come and see what the LORD has done, working appallingly in the earth.
\v 9 He stills wars to the ends of the earth –breaking the bow, snapping the spear, burning the chariots in the fire.
\v 10 “Refrain; and know surely that I am God, high over the nations, high over the world.”
\v 11 On our side is the LORD of Hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. Selah

Psalm 47 – The Lord’s Universal SovereigntyFor the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.
\v 1 Clap your hands, all you peoples: shout to God in ringing cries.
\v 2 For the LORD is most high and dread, a great king over all the earth.
\v 3 He subdues the peoples under us, the nations under our feet;
\v 4 he chooses our heritage for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loves. Selah
\v 5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
\v 6 Sing praise to our God, sing praises: sing praise to our king, sing praises.
\v 7 For king of all earth is he: praise God in a skilful song.
\v 8 God is king over all the nations, God sits on his holy throne.

Psalm 48 – The Marvelous Deliverance of ZionA song. A psalm of the Korahites.
\v 1 Great is the LORD and worthy all praisein the city of our God. His holy mountain,
\v 2 that rises so fair, is the joy of all the world. Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion, the city of the great king.
\v 3 Once God made himself knownas the defence of her palaces.
\v 4 For see! A concert of kingspassed over the frontier together.
\v 5 But one glance, and they were astounded; they hastened away in dismay.
\v 6 Trembling took hold of them there, like the pains of a woman in labor.
\v 7 They were shattered, as east wind shattersthe giant ships in pieces.
\v 8 What we heard, we now have seenin the city of the LORD of hosts, the city of our God. God will uphold her forever. Selah
\v 9 We think, O God, of your love, in the midst of your temple.
\v 10 Your fame, O God, like your name, shall extendto the ends of the earth. Victory fills your hand.
\v 11 Let mount Zion be glad; let the daughters of Judah rejoicebecause of your judgments.
\v 12 Walk about Zion, go round her; count her towers.
\v 13 Set your mind on her ramparts, consider her palaces; that you tell to the next generation
\v 14 That such is God, our God he it is who shall guide usfor ever and ever.

Psalm 49 – The Problem of the Prosperity of the WickedFor the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.
\v 1 Hear this, you peoples all; attend, all you who live in the world
\v 2 people of low degree and high, the rich and the poor together.
\v 3 My mouth shall utter wisdom, the thoughts of a seeing heart.
\v 4 I incline my ear to a proverb, on the lyre I will open my riddle.
\v 5 Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune, when circled by wicked and cunning foes,
\v 6 who put their trust in their wealth, and boast of their boundless riches?
\v 7 For assuredly no one can ransom themselves, or give to God the price of their life,
\v 8 for the ransom of a life is costly, no payment is ever enough,
\v 9 to keep them alive for ever and ever, so as never to see the pit at all.
\v 10 But see it they will. Even wise people die, the fool and the brutish perish alike, and abandon their wealth to others.
\v 11 The grave is their everlasting home, the place they shall live in for ever and ever, though after their own names they called whole lands.
\v 12 Despite their wealth, they perish like dumb animals.
\v 13 This is the fate of the confident fool, and the end of those who are pleased with their portion. Selah
\v 14 Like sheep they descend to Sheolwith Death for their shepherd; down they go straight to the grave, and their form wastes away in their home below.
\v 15 But God will assuredly ransom my lifefrom the hand of Sheol; for he will receive me. Selah
\v 16 So be not afraid when someone grows rich, when the wealth of their house increases.
\v 17 Not a shred of it all can they take when they die, wealth cannot follow them down.
\v 18 Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive, and win praise from many for faring so well,
\v 19 they must join their ancestors, who see the light nevermore.
\v 20 The wealthy are without understanding, they perish like dumb animals.

Psalm 50 – True WorshipA psalm of Asaph.
\v 1 The LORD God has spoken: He summons the earthfrom sunrise to sunset.
\v 2 From Zion, perfection of beauty, God’s glory shines forth.
\v 3 Our God comes, he cannot keep silence, devouring fire is before him, and furious tempest around him.
\v 4 He summons the heavens aboveand the earth to judge his people.
\v 5 Gather to him his saintsby covenant-sacrifice bound to him;
\v 6 that the heavens may declare his justice, for a God of justice is he. Selah
\v 7 “Hear, O my people, and I will speak, and protest to you, O Israel: I am the LORD, your God.
\v 8 Not for your sacrifices will I reprove youyour burnt-offerings are ever before me
\v 9 Not a bullock will I take from your house, nor male goats out of your folds;
\v 10 for all beasts of the forest are mine, and the kine on a thousand hills.
\v 11 I know all the birds of the air, all that moves on the fields is mine.
\v 12 Were I hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fulness are mine.
\v 13 Am I such as to eat bulls’ flesh, or drink the blood of goats?
\v 14 Offer to God a thank-offering, pay the Most High your vows.
\v 15 Summon me in the day of distress, I will rescue you, so will you honor me.”
\v 16 But to the wicked God says: “What right have you to talk of my statutes, or take my covenant into your mouth
\v 17 while you yourself hate correction, and cast my words behind you?
\v 18 When you see a thief, you run with them; with adulterers you keep company.
\v 19 You let your mouth loose for evil, your tongue contrives deceit.
\v 20 You shamefully speak of your kin, and slander your own mother’s son.
\v 21 And because I kept silence at this, you did take me for one like yourself. But I will convict you and show you plainly.
\v 22 “Now you who forget God, mark this, lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.
\v 23 Those who bring a thank-offering honor me; but to those who follow my way, I will show the salvation of God.”

Psalm 51 – God be Merciful to Me, the SinnerFor the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him after he had been with Bathsheba.
\v 1 In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me, in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
\v 2 Wash me clean of my guilt, make me pure of my sin.
\v 3 For well I know my transgressions, my sin is ever before me.
\v 4 Against you, only you, have I sinned, and done that which is wrong in your sight: you therefore are just when you speak, and clear when you utter judgment.
\v 5 See! In guilt was I brought to the birth, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
\v 6 It’s the innermost truth you desire, give me therefore true wisdom of heart.
\v 7 Purge me clean with hyssop, wash me whiter than snow.
\v 8 Fill me with joy and gladness, let the bones you have broken rejoice.
\v 9 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out my guilt altogether.
\v 10 Create me a clean heart, O God, put a new steadfast spirit within me.
\v 11 Cast me not forth from your presence, withdraw not your holy spirit.
\v 12 Give me back the joy of your help, with a willing spirit sustain me.
\v 13 I will teach your ways to transgressors, and sinners shall turn to you.
\v 14 Save me from blood, O God, and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
\v 15 Open my lips, O LORD, and my mouth shall declare your praise.
\v 16 For in sacrifice you have no pleasure, in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
\v 17 The sacrifice pleasing to Godis a spirit that is broken; a heart that is crushed, O God, you will not despise.
\v 18 Do good in your pleasure to Zion, build the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 19 Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice, then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.

Psalm 52 – The Doom of ArroganceFor the leader. A maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul that David had gone to Abimelech’s house.
\v 1 Why glory in mischief, you hero? God’s kindness is all the day.
\v 2 Engulfing ruin you plot, your tongue like a razor sharpened, you practiser of deceit.
\v 3 Evil, not good, you love, and falsehood, not words of truth. Selah
\v 4 But you love all words that devour, and a tongue that is given to deceit.
\v 5 But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever, grasp you and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah
\v 6 Smitten with awe at the sight, the righteous shall laugh at you.
\v 7 “Look” (they will say) “at the herowho did not make God his stronghold, but trusted in his great wealthand in the strength of his riches.”
\v 8 But I am like a fresh olive-treein the house of God. I trust in the kindness of Godfor ever and evermore.
\v 9 I will render you thanks for everfor what you have done. I will tell how good you arein the presence of those who love you.

Psalm 53 – The Folly of Denying GodRevision 2For the leader. On mahalath. A maskil of David.
\v 1 Fools say in their heart, “There is no God.”Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.
\v 2 From heaven God looks outon humans, to seeif any are wise, and care for God.
\v 3 But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.
\v 4 Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the LORD.
\v 5 Sore afraid will they be, where no fear was; when God scatters the bonesof the godless people. They will be put to shame, when God rejects them.
\v 6 If only help from Zionwould come for Israel! When God brings his peoplea change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!

Psalm 54 – A Prayer for Deliverance from OppressionFor the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, ‘David is in hiding among us’.
\v 1 Save me, O God, by your name, by your power secure for me justice.
\v 2 Listen, O God, to my prayer, attend to the words of my mouth.
\v 3 For proud men have risen against me, and terrible men seek my life, men who do not set God before them. Selah
\v 4 But see! God is my helper, the LORD is sustaining my life.
\v 5 Let their evil fall back on my foes: cut them off in your faithfulness, LORD.
\v 6 Then will I bring you glad sacrifice, praising your gracious name;

Psalm 55 – Betrayed by a FriendRevision 2For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David.
\v 1 Listen, God, to my prayer. Don’t hide yourself from my pleading.
\v 2 Hear me, and answer; for bitter is my lament.
\v 3 I am wild with the noise of the foe, with the clamor of the ungodly; for they hurl disaster upon me, and attack me with fury.
\v 4 My heart shudders within me, terrors of deaths press on me,
\v 5 fear and trembling attack me, and horror wraps me round.
\v 6 O for the wings of a dove: I would fly away and rest.
\v 7 I would wander far away, find refuge in the wilderness. Selah
\v 8 I would find myself a shelterfrom raging wind and tempest.
\v 9 Confuse them, LORD, upset their plans; for I see violence and strife in the city.
\v 10 By day and by night they make their roundson the city walls, while within is crime and trouble,
\v 11 within is ruin. Her market-place is never freeof deceit and tyranny. The Treacherous Friend
\v 12 The taunts were not those of a foethat I could have borne; the disdain was not that of an enemyI could have shunned them:
\v 13 but it was you, my equal, my dear and familiar friend.
\v 14 We used to be so close, together we walked in God’s house with the crowd.
\v 15 May death suddenly take them, may they go down to Sheol alive, for evil lives in their homes and their hearts.
\v 16 But I will call on God, the LORD will save me.
\v 17 Evening and morning and noonI lament and moan. He will hear my voice;
\v 18 though I am attacked by manyhe will rescue me, unharmed from the war.
\v 19 God, who sits on his ancient thronewill hear and will humble them, for they never change, they never reverence God. Selah
\v 20 My friend turned against me, betrayed his word.
\v 21 His mouth was smoother than butter, but war filled his heart. His words were softer than oil, but sharper than swords.
\v 22 Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you. He will never let the righteousbe shaken.
\v 23 But you, God, will hurl them downto the deepest pit. Bloody and treacherous peoplewill not live out half their days; but I will trust you.

Psalm 56 – A Prayer of Trust in GodFor the leader. On jonath elem rehokim. Of David. A michtam, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.
\v 1 O God, be gracious to me, for people trample upon me, all the day righting and pressing me.
\v 2 All the day enemies trample me; many there bewho contend with me bitterly.
\v 3 In the day of my terrorI trust in you.
\v 4 In God I maintain my cause, in God I fearlessly trust. What can flesh do to me?
\v 5 They torture me all the day, they ceaselessly plan to hurt me,
\v 6 banded together in secret, watching my every step, as those who hope for my death.
\v 7 Pay them out for their sin, O God, hurl down the strong in your anger.
\v 8 You yourself count my wanderings. Put in your bottle my tearsare they not in your book?
\v 9 Then shall my foes be turned backin the day that I call. Of this I am sure, because God is for me.
\v 10 In God I maintain my cause, in the LORD I maintain my cause.
\v 11 In God I fearlessly trust, what can people do to me?
\v 12 Your vows are upon me, O God, I will render thank-offerings to you;
\v 13 because you have saved me from death, my feet from stumbling, to the end that I walk before Godin the light of the living.

Psalm 57 – A Prayer for Protection from PersecutionFor the leader. Al tashheth. A michtam of David, when he fled from Saul into a cave.
\v 1 Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me, for in you I take shelter. In your sheltering wings I take refuge, till ruin be over past.
\v 2 I cry to the Most High God, to the God who accomplishes for me.
\v 3 He will send me his succour from heaven, he will thrust away those who would trample me. Selah
\v 4 In the midst of lions I lie, who devour human prey. Their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue is a sharpened sword.
\v 5 Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.
\v 6 They set a net for my feet, but in it was their own foot caught. Before me they dug a pit, but they fell into it themselves. Selah
\v 7 My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music;
\v 8 awake, my soul. Awake, harp and lyre; I would wake the dawn.
\v 9 I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD, and make music among the nations to you;
\v 10 for great to heaven is your love, and your faithfulness to the clouds.
\v 11 Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.

Psalm 58 – A Prayer for Vengeance on Unjust JudgesFor the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam.
\v 1 Do you speak what is right, you gods? With equity judge you your people?
\v 2 In the land you practise iniquity – all of you; violence do you dispense with your hands.
\v 3 The wicked go astray from the wombliars take the wrong path from their birth.
\v 4 Venom have they like the venom of snakes, they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears,
\v 5 and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer, or binder of spells, no matter how cunning.
\v 6 O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth, tear out the great teeth of the young lions, LORD.
\v 7 May they melt away like running water! Like tender grass, cut down may they be!
\v 8 Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path, like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight.
\v 9 Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots, he will come with his tempest and sweep them away.
\v 10 The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous; their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked.
\v 11 People will say, “Yes, the just are rewarded: yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.”

Psalm 59 – A Prayer for SafetyFor the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam, when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him.
\v 1 Save me, O God, from my enemies; secure me from my assailants.
\v 2 Save me from those who do wrong, save me from the bloodthirsty.
\v 3 For see! They lay ambush for me, strong men are banded against menot for sin or transgression of mine, for no guilt of mine, O LORD,
\v 4 they run and make ready. Awake! Come forth to meet me, and see!
\v 5 You, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, awake! And punish the proud, every one; spare none of the traitors vile. Selah
\v 6 At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.
\v 7 Look at their venomous mouths, tongues like swords, they think no onehears them.
\v 8 But you, LORD, laugh at them, you mock all the insolent.
\v 9 My strength, I will sing to you, for God is my sure retreat.
\v 10 My God with his love will meet me, and feast my eyes on my foes.
\v 11 Slay them not, lest my people forget, let your hosts keep them roaming and wandering.
\v 12 In their sinful speech snare them, O LORD; and may they be trapped in their pride, for the curses and lies that they utter.
\v 13 In your wrath make a clean end of them, that people, to the ends of the earth, may know that God rules in Jacob. Selah
\v 14 At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.
\v 15 They roam about for a feast, and snarl, if they get not their fill.
\v 16 But I will sing of your might; I will ring out your love in the morning. For to me you have been a sure refuge, a retreat in the day of my trouble.
\v 17 My strength, I will sing praise to you, for God is my sure retreat, my faithful God.

Psalm 60 – A Prayer after Defeat in BattleFor the leader. On shushan eduth. A michtam of David (for teaching), when he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and defeated twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
\v 1 O God, you have spurned and broken us, routing us in your wrath – restore us!
\v 2 You have shaken the land and cleft it; heal its tottering breaches.
\v 3 You have made your people drink hardship, and given us wine of reeling.
\v 4 You have given those who revere you a banner, a rallying-place from the bow, Selah
\v 5 for the rescue of your beloved. Save by your right hand and answer us.
\v 6 God did solemnly swear: “As victor will I divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
\v 7 Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh, Ephraim is the defence of my head, Judah my sceptre of rule,
\v 8 Moab the pot that I wash in, Edom – I cast my shoe over it, I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.”
\v 9 O to be brought to the fortified city! O to be led into Edom!
\v 10 Have you not spurned us, O God? You do not march forth with our armies.
\v 11 Grant us help from the foe, for human help is worthless.
\v 12 With God we shall yet do bravely: he himself will tread down our foes.

Psalm 61 – Our God is a Strong TowerFor the leader. On stringed instruments. Of David.
\v 1 Hear my cry, O God, be attentive to my prayer.
\v 2 From the ends of the earth I callunto you, when my heart is faint: lead me to the rockthat is high above me.
\v 3 For you are a refuge to me, a strong tower in face of the foe.
\v 4 O to be guest in your tent forever, hiding beneath your sheltering wings! Selah
\v 5 For you, O God, do hear my vows, and grant the desires of those who revere you.
\v 6 Add many days to the life of the king; may his years endure throughout all generations.
\v 7 In the presence of God be he throned forever; may kindness and faithfulness watch over him.
\v 8 And I will sing praise to your name forever, paying my vows day after day.

Psalm 62 – Quietness and ConfidenceFor the leader. On jeduthun. A psalm of David.
\v 1 I wait alone in silence for God; From him comes my help.
\v 2 Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat, I shall not be shaken too sorely.
\v 3 How long will you, all of you, batter a man, as one might a leaning wall?
\v 4 From his heightthey are planning to topple him. They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth, but inwardly they curse. Selah
\v 5 I wait alone in silence for God; for from him comes my hope.
\v 6 Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat, I shall not be shaken too sorely.
\v 7 On God rests my honor and safety, in God is my strong rock, my refuge.
\v 8 Trust in him, all you people assembled, pour out your heart in his presence; God is a refuge for us. Selah
\v 9 The lowly are nought but a breath, the lofty are but an illusion: in the balances up they go, they are lighter than breath altogether.
\v 10 Trust not in gain of extortion, set no vain hopes in robbery. As for wealth, if it bears fruit, set not your heart upon it.
\v 11 One thing God has uttered, two things there are which I heardthat power belongs to God,
\v 12 and to you, too, O LORD, belongs kindness; for you requite each personaccording to what they have done.

Psalm 63 – Athirst for GodA psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
\v 1 O God, my God, you, you do I seek: my heart thirsts for you, my body faints for youin a parched and waterless land.
\v 2 As I in the temple have seen you, beholding your power and your glory,
\v 3 for better than life is your kindness: my lips shall utter your praise.
\v 4 So, while I live, I will bless you, and lift up my hands in your name.
\v 5 As with marrow and fat am I feasted; with joyful lips I will praise you.
\v 6 I call you to mind on my bed, and muse on you in the night watches;
\v 7 for you have been my help, I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings.
\v 8 I cling close after you, your right hand holds me up.
\v 9 But those who seek after my lifeshall go down to the depths of the earth,
\v 10 given o’er to the power of the sword, or as prey for jackals to devour.
\v 11 But the king shall rejoice in God: all who own his allegiance will glory. For the mouth of the false shall be stopped.

Psalm 64 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious FoesFor the leader. A psalm of David.
\v 1 Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament: guard my life from the dread of the foe.
\v 2 Hide me from villains who secretly plot, from the blustering throng of the workers of evil,
\v 3 who have sharpened their tongue like a sword, and aimed bitter words like arrows,
\v 4 which from ambush they launch at the blameless, shooting swiftly and unafraid.
\v 5 They strengthen their wicked purpose, they tell of the snares they have hidden, they say to themselves, “Who can see?”
\v 6 They think out their crimes full cunninglyhidden deep in their crafty hearts.
\v 7 But God with his arrow will shoot them, swiftly shall they be smitten.
\v 8 For their tongue he will bring them to ruin, all will shudder with horror at the sight of them.
\v 9 Then every person, touched to awe, as they ponder what God has wrought, will tell the tale of his deeds.
\v 10 In the LORD shall the righteous rejoice, in him shall they take refuge; and all the true-hearted shall glory.

Psalm 65 – Hymn for a Thanksgiving FestivalFor the leader. A psalm of David. A song.
\v 1 It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion, and to you shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
\v 2 O you who hear prayer, unto you shall all flesh come.
\v 3 Our sins are too mighty for us, our transgressions you only can cover them.
\v 4 Happy the person who you chooseto live beside you in your courts. O may we be filled with the joysof your house, of your holy temple.
\v 5 In dread deeds you loyally answer us, O God of our salvation, whom all ends of the earth put their trust in, and islands far away.
\v 6 By your strength you establish the hills, you are armed with might;
\v 7 you still the roaring of seas, and the turmoil of nations,
\v 8 so that those who live at earth’s boundsare awed at your signs: the lands of the sunrise and sunsetyou make to ring with joy.
\v 9 You visit and water the earth; you greatly enrich herwith the river of God, which is full of water. You prepare the corn thereof,
\v 10 watering her furrows, settling her ridges; you make her soft with showers, and bless what grows thereon.
\v 11 You crown the year with your goodness, your chariot tracks drip with fatness.
\v 12 The desert pastures are lush, the hills greened with joy.
\v 13 The meadows are clothed with flocks, the valleys are covered with corn; they shout to each other and sing.

Psalm 66 – Thanksgiving for National DeliveranceFor the leader. A song. A psalm.
\v 1 Shout to God, all the earth,
\v 2 sing praise to his glorious name, sing his glorious praise.
\v 3 Say to God, “How dread are your works, so great is your might that your enemies cringe to you.
\v 4 All the earth does homage to you, singing praises to you, singing praise to your name.” Selah
\v 5 Come and see what God has done, awe-inspiring is he in his works among people.
\v 6 He turns the sea into dry land, and people cross the river on foot. Let us therefore rejoice in him,
\v 7 the mighty Ruler eternal, whose eyes keep watch on the nations, that no rebel lift up his head. Selah
\v 8 O bless our God, you peoples; sound aloud his praise,
\v 9 who keeps us in life, and keeps our feet from slipping.
\v 10 For you, God, have tested us, have tried us, as silver is tried.
\v 11 You did bring us into prison, and put chains upon us,
\v 12 you did let people ride over our head. We went through fire and through water, but you led us out to a spacious place.
\v 13 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings, I will pay to you my vows,
\v 14 which my open lips have uttered, arid my mouth has declared in my straits.
\v 15 I will offer you offerings of fatlings, with the odour of burning rams, I will sacrifice bullocks with goats. Selah
\v 16 Come and hear my storyall who hold God in awe –of what he has done for me.
\v 17 For my mouth had no sooner invoked himthan his praise was under my tongue.
\v 18 Had I cherished sin in my heart, the LORD would never have listened.
\v 19 But assuredly God has listened, and attended to my loud prayer.
\v 20 Blessed be God, who turned not asidemy prayer, nor withdrew his kindness from me.

Psalm 68 – VictoryFor the leader. Of David. A psalm. A song.
\v 1 God arises, his enemies scatter: they who hate him flee before him.
\v 2 As smoke before wind is driven, as wax melts before fire, so before God vanish the wicked.
\v 3 But the righteous rejoice in God’s presence, they exult with exceeding joy.
\v 4 Sing to God, make music to his name, his name is the LORD, praise him who rides on the clouds, and exult in his presence.
\v 5 Father of orphans, defender of widows, is God in his holy abode.
\v 6 God brings home the lonely, he leads forth the prisoner to comfort, so that none but the rebel lives cheerless.
\v 7 God, when you went in front of your peoplein your march through the desert, Selah
\v 8 earth shook, the heavens poured rainat the presence of God, Sinai’s Godat the presence of God, Israel’s God.
\v 9 Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle, restoring the languishing land of your heritage.
\v 10 A dwelling therein your people found: in your goodness, O God, you did care for the poor.
\v 11 The LORD spoke the glad tidings of victory, a great army of women proclaim it:
\v 12 “Kings of armies they flee, they flee, and the housewife divides the spoil:
\v 13 dove’s wings covered with silverand pinions with shimmer of gold,
\v 14 set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.”
\v 15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan, a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
\v 16 You high-peaked mountains, why look you askanceat the mountain which God has desired for his homewhereon the LORD will live forever?
\v 17 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand: the LORD came from Sinai, his holy place.
\v 18 You did mount the height with trains of your captives, and gifts that you had received from the people. The rebels shall live with the LORD God.
\v 19 Blest be the LORD who sustains us daily, the God who is also our savior. Selah
\v 20 Our God is a God who is savior. The ways of escape from deathare known to the LORD God.
\v 21 Yes, God will shatter the head of his foesthe rough scalp of those who strut on in their sins.
\v 22 The LORD said: “I will bring you home from Bashan, home from the depths of the sea,
\v 23 that your feet you may bathe in blood, and your dogs lick their share of the foe.”
\v 24 In the temple appear God’s triumphal processions, processions in praise of my king and my God,
\v 25 with singers in front, and minstrels behind, and maidens with timbrels between them, singing,
\v 26 “You of the well-spring of Israel, bless the LORD God in the dance.”
\v 27 There, in front, is Benjamin the little, the princes of Judah beside them, the princes of Zebulon, princes of Naphtali.
\v 28 God, show your strength, your godlike might, as you did in the past,
\v 29 from your temple that crowns Jerusalem. Kings shall bring tribute to you.
\v 30 Rebuke the beast of the reed, the herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples. Trample down the lovers of lies. Scatter the nations whose joy is in war.
\v 31 May they come from Egypt with gifts of oil, Ethiopia haste with full hands to God.
\v 32 Sing to God, O you kingdoms of earth, make melody to the LORD. Selah
\v 33 Praise him who rides on the ancient heavens. See! He utters his voice, his mighty voice.
\v 34 Ascribe strength to the God over Israel, whose strength and majesty live in the skies.
\v 35 Awe-inspiring is God in his holy place, it is Israel’s Godwho gives strength and might to his people. Blessed be God.

Psalm 69 – A Prayer for Deliverance and VengeanceFor the leader. On shoshannim. Of David.
\v 1 Save me, O God; for the watersare threatening my life.
\v 2 I am sunk in depths of mire, where ground there is none. I am come into deep deep waters, the flood overwhelms me.
\v 3 I am weary of crying, my throat is parched, my eyes are wasted with waiting for God.
\v 4 More than the hairs of my headare those who wantonly hate me. More than my bones in numberare those who are falsely my foes. That which I never robbed, how am I then to restore?
\v 5 O God, you know my folly, my guilt is not hidden from you.
\v 6 Through me let not any be shamed, who wait for you, LORD God of hosts. Through me let not those be confoundedwho seek you, O God of Israel.
\v 7 It’s in your cause that I have borne taunts, and my face has been covered with shame;
\v 8 I became to my kindred a foreigner, to my mother’s sons a stranger.
\v 9 It was zeal for your house that consumed me, and the insults they hurled at you fell upon me.
\v 10 When I chastened myself with fasting, they took occasion to taunt me.
\v 11 When I put on a garment of sackcloth, they made me the theme of a taunt-song.
\v 12 Those who sit in the gate make sport of mein the music of drunken songs.
\v 13 But I pray to you, LORD, for a time of favor. In your great love answer me; with your loyal help, save me
\v 14 from sinking down in the mire. Lift me out of the deep deep waters,
\v 15 that the rushing flood may not drown me, that the deep may not swallow me up, nor the pit close her mouth upon me.
\v 16 Answer me, LORD, in your gracious kindness, turn to me in your great compassion.
\v 17 Hide not your face from your servant, for I am in trouble; O answer me speedily.
\v 18 Draw near to me, redeem me; because of my enemies, ransom me.
\v 19 You know how I am insulted; in your sight are all my foes.
\v 20 Insult has broken my heart, past cure are my shame and confusion. For pity I looked – there was none! And for comforters, but I found none.
\v 21 Poison they gave me for food, and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar.
\v 22 May their table, outspread, be a trap to them, and their peace-offerings be a snare.
\v 23 May their eyes be darkened and blind, make them shake without ceasing.
\v 24 Pour your indignation upon them, let your burning wrath overtake them.
\v 25 May their camp be a desolation, in their tents be there none to live.
\v 26 For those whom you struck, they persecute, and those whom you wounded, they pain yet more.
\v 27 Charge them with sin upon sin, may they not be acquitted by you.
\v 28 From the book of life be they blotted, may their names not be written with the righteous.
\v 29 Lift me, O God, by your helpabove my pain and misery.
\v 30 Then will I praise God in songand magnify him with thanksgiving,
\v 31 which shall please the LORD better than ox, or than bullock with horns and hoofs.
\v 32 The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight. You who seek after God, let your heart revive.
\v 33 For the LORD listens to the poor, he does not despise his prisoners.
\v 34 Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises, the seas, and all creatures that move in them.
\v 35 For God will bring help to Zion, and build up the cities of Judah, his people shall live there in possession.
\v 36 His servants’ children shall have it for heritage, and those who love him shall live therein.

Psalm 71 – Forsake me not, when I am Old
\v 1 In you, O LORD, I take refuge, let me never be put to shame.
\v 2 In your faithfulness save me and rescue me, bend your ear to me and save me.
\v 3 Be to me a rock of defence, a fortified house, to save me; for my rock and my fortress are you.
\v 4 Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
\v 5 For you, LORD, are my hope, in whom from my youth I have trusted.
\v 6 On you have I leaned from my birth; from my mother’s womb it was you who did draw me. In you is my hope evermore.
\v 7 I have been as a wonder to many, for you are my refuge and strength.
\v 8 All the day long my mouthis filled with your praise and your glory.
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; when my strength is spent, forsake me not.
\v 10 For my foes whisper against me, they who watch me take counsel together;
\v 11 “God has left him,” they say: “pursueand seize him, for he is helpless.”
\v 12 O God, be not far from me, haste, O my God, to my help.
\v 13 Put my foes to shame and dishonor, with insult and shame be they covered.
\v 14 But I will never stop hoping, and more and yet more will I praise you.
\v 15 All the day long shall my mouthtell your faithfulness and your salvation, though I know not how they may be counted.
\v 16 I will tell of the might of the LORD, and your faithfulness praise, you alone.
\v 17 You have taught me, O God, from my youth, and till now have I told of your wonders.
\v 18 Even in old age and grey hair, O God, do not forsake me. Still would I tell of your mightunto all generations to come.
\v 19 Your power and your justice, O God, extend as far as the heavens: for great are the things you have done. Who is like you, O God?
\v 20 You have caused us to see troubles many, but you will revive us again. From the depths of the earthyou will bring me up again.
\v 21 You will multiply my greatness, and comfort me again.
\v 22 So with harp I will praise you, and your faithfulness, O my God; and make music to you on the lyre, O you Holy One of Israel.
\v 23 My lips shall ring out their joy, my mouth shall sing praises to you; all of me, which you have redeemed.
\v 24 Yes, all the day long shall my tongueutter your righteousness; for ashamed and confounded are theywho were seeking my hurt.

\v 1 Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justiceyour spirit of right to the son of the king,
\v 2 that with right he may judge your people, and your downtrodden ones with justice.

Book ThreePsalm 73 – Fellowship with God Here and HereafterA psalm of Asaph.
\v 1 Yes, God is good to the upright, the LORD to the pure in heart.
\v 2 But my feet were almost gone, my steps had nearly slipped,
\v 3 through envy of godless braggarts, when I saw how well they fared.
\v 4 For never a pang have they, their body is sound and sleek.
\v 5 They have no trouble like mortals, no share in human pain.
\v 6 So they wear their pride like a necklace, they put on the garment of wrong,
\v 7 their eyes stand out with fatness, their heart swells with riotous fancies.
\v 8 Their speech is mocking and evil, condescending and crooked their speech.
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens, while their tongue struts about on the earth.
\v 10 Small wonder that people resort to them, and drink deep draughts of their lore.
\v 11 “How does God know?” they say, “And has the Most High any knowledge?”
\v 12 See! These are the godless, with wealth and ease ever increasing.
\v 13 Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure, and washed my hands in innocence;
\v 14 for all the day long was I plaguednot a morning but I was chastised.
\v 15 But to resolve to speak like they dowould be treachery to your children.
\v 16 So I sought to understand it, but a wearisome task it seemed:
\v 17 till I entered the holy world of Godand saw clearly their destiny.
\v 18 Yes, you set them on slippery places; down to destruction you hurl them.
\v 19 One moment and then what a horror of ruin! They are finished and ended in terrors.
\v 20 Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be, whose phantoms the waker despises.
\v 21 So my bitterness of mindand the pain that stabbed my heart
\v 22 show how dull I was and stupidjust like a beast before you.
\v 23 But I am always with you, you have hold of my right hand.
\v 24 By a plan of yours you guide meand will afterward take me to glory.
\v 25 Whom have I in the heavens but you? And on earth there is none I desire beside you.
\v 26 Though flesh and heart waste away, yet God is the rock of my heart, yet God is my portion forever.
\v 27 For see! Those who are far from you must perish, you destroy all who are false to you.
\v 28 But I am happy when close to God; the LORD my God I have made my refuge, that I may recount all the things you have done.

Psalm 74 – Lament on the Devastation of the TempleA maskil of Asaph.
\v 1 Why, O God, have you spurned us forever? Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?
\v 2 Remember the community you purchased of oldto become by redemption the tribe of your heritage, Zion, the mountain you made your home.
\v 3 Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete. In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.
\v 4 Like lions your enemies roared through your house, replacing our symbols by signs of their own,
\v 5 hacking, like woodsmen who liftaxes on thickets of trees,
\v 6 smashing with hatchets and hammersall of its carved work together.
\v 7 They have set your temple on fire, to the very ground they have outragedthe place where lives your name.
\v 8 They have said in their heart, “Let us utterly crush them.”They have burned all the houses of God in the land.
\v 9 No symbol of ours do we see any more: no prophet is there any more, none is with us who knows how long.
\v 10 How long, O God, is the foe to insult? Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?
\v 11 Why, O LORD, do you hold back your hand, why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?
\v 12 Yet God is our king from the ancient days, in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.
\v 13 It was you who did cleave the sea by your might, and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.
\v 14 It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan, and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.
\v 15 It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents; it was you who did dry the perennial streams.
\v 16 Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night, it was you who did establish the sun and the star.
\v 17 It was you who did fix all the borders of earth: summer and winter it’s you who have made them.
\v 18 Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, LORD, and a nation of fools has reviled your name.
\v 19 Do not give your dove to the beasts, do not forget your afflicted forever.
\v 20 Look to the sleek ones – how full they are: the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.
\v 21 O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed: let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.
\v 22 Arise, God, and defend your cause: remember how fools all the day insult you.
\v 23 Do not forget the uproar of your enemies, the din of your foes that ascends evermore.

Psalm 75 – God the JudgeFor the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song.
\v 1 We praise you, God, we praise you: we would call on your name and declare your wonders.
\v 2 “At the time I choose, I will judge fairly.
\v 3 Though earth melt and all her inhabitants, it is I who keep steady her pillars.” Selah
\v 4 I say to the boasters, “Boast not”; to the wicked, “Lift not up your horn:
\v 5 lift not your horn on high, speak not boldly against the Rock.”
\v 6 For not from east nor west, not from desert nor mountains;
\v 7 but God himself is the judge, humbling one and exalting another.
\v 8 In the hand of the LORD is a cupfoaming wine, richly spiced. Out of this he pours a draught, and all the wicked of earthmust drain it down to the dregs.
\v 9 But I will rejoice forever, singing praise to the God of Jacob.
\v 10 I will hew all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the just shall be lifted.

Psalm 76 – A Song of VictoryFor the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song.
\v 1 God has made himself known in Judah, his name is great in Israel.
\v 2 His tent is in Salem, his dwelling in Zion.
\v 3 There he broke the lightning arrows, shield, sword, and weapons of war. Selah
\v 4 Terrible is your splendoron the everlasting mountains.
\v 5 Despoiled were the stout of heart; in the sleep into which they had fallen, none of the warriorscould lift a hand.
\v 6 At your rebuke, God of Jacob, sank chariot and horse to sleep.
\v 7 Awful are you: who can standbefore you, when once you are angry?
\v 8 The judgment you gave from heavenfrightened the earth into silence,
\v 9 when God arose to judgmentto save the oppressed of the earth. Selah
\v 10 The fiercest will praise you, to you will the remnant hold festival.
\v 11 Vow and pay to LORD your God, and let all who are round him bring presents.
\v 12 He lops off the courage of princes, and with terror fills kings of the earth.

Psalm 77 – A Prayer for Preservation as in the Days of OldFor the leader. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph, a psalm.
\v 1 Loudly will I lift my cry to God, loudly to God, so he hears to me.
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I seek the LORD; in the night I lift my hands in prayer, refusing all comfort.
\v 3 When I think of God, I moan; when I muse, my spirit is faint. Selah
\v 4 When you hold my eyes awake, and I am restless and speechless,
\v 5 I think of the days of old, call to mind distant years.
\v 6 I commune with my heart in the night, I muse with inquiring spirit.
\v 7 “Will the LORD cast us off forever, will he be gracious no more?
\v 8 Has his love vanished forever? Is his faithfulness utterly gone?
\v 9 Has God forgotten to be gracious, or in anger withheld his compassion?” Selah
\v 10 Then I said, “This it is that grieves me, that the hand of the Most High has changed.”
\v 11 I will think of the deeds of the LORD, and remember your wonders of old.
\v 12 I will muse on all you have wrought, and meditate on your deeds.
\v 13 Then your way, O God, was majestic: what God was great as our God?
\v 14 You were a God who did marvels, you did show your power to the world
\v 15 by your arm you rescued your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
\v 16 The waters saw you, O God. The waters saw you and shivered; to their depths they trembled.
\v 17 Clouds poured torrents of water, thunder rolled in the sky, your arrows sped to and fro.
\v 18 Loud was the roll of your thunder, lightnings lit up the world. Earth quaked and trembled.
\v 19 In your way, LORD, through the sea, in your path through the mighty waters, your footsteps were all unseen.
\v 20 You did guide your folk like a flockby the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Psalm 78 – The Warnings of HistoryA maskil of Asaph.
\v 1 My people, attend to my teaching: bend your ears to the words of my mouth,
\v 2 as I open my mouth in a poemon the riddling story of the past.
\v 3 What we have heard and known, and what our ancestors have told us,
\v 4 we will not hide from their children. We will tell to the next generationthe praises and might of the LORD, and the wonders that he has done.
\v 5 He set up a testimony in Jacob, a law he appointed in Israel, which he commanded our ancestorsto make known to their children,
\v 6 that the next generation should know it, that the children yet to be bornshould arise and tell their children;
\v 7 that in God they might put their confidence, and not forget God’s works; but that they might keep his commandments,
\v 8 and not be like their ancestors, a generation defiant and stubborn, a generation with heart unsteady, and spirit unfaithful towards God.
\v 9 Ephraimites, armed bowmen, turned back in the day of battle.
\v 10 They did not keep God’s covenant, they refused to walk in his law.
\v 11 They forgot what he had done, and the wonders he had shown them.
\v 12 He did wonders before their ancestorsin the country of Zoan in Egypt.
\v 13 Through the sea which he split he brought them, making waters stand up like a heap;
\v 14 he led them by day with a cloud, all the night with a light of fire.
\v 15 From the rocks which he split in the wilderness, he gave them to drink as of ocean’s abundance.
\v 16 He brought streams out of the rock, and made water run down like rivers.
\v 17 Yet they still went on sinning against him, they defied the Most High in the desert.
\v 18 They willfully challenged God, demanding the food that they longed for.
\v 19 “Is God able,” such was their challenge, “to spread in the desert a table?
\v 20 From the rock that he struck there gushed water, and torrents that overflowed; but can he also give bread, or provide his people with meat?”
\v 21 When the LORD heard this, he was furious, and fire was kindled on Jacob, anger flared up against Israel.
\v 22 For they put no trust in God, no confidence in his help.
\v 23 So he summoned the clouds above; and, opening the doors of heaven,
\v 24 he rained manna upon them for food, and grain of heaven he gave them.
\v 25 Everyone ate the bread of angels; he sent them food to the full.
\v 26 He launched the east wind in the heavens, and guided the south by his power.
\v 27 He rained meat upon them like dust, winged bird like the sand of the sea.
\v 28 In the midst of their camp he dropped it, all around their tents.
\v 29 They ate and were more than filled; he had brought them the thing they desired.
\v 30 But the thing they desired became loathsome: while their food was still in their mouths,
\v 31 the wrath of God rose against them. He slew the stoutest among them, and laid low the young men of Israel.
\v 32 Yet for all this they sinned yet more, and refused to believe in his wonders.
\v 33 So he ended their days in a breath, and their years in sudden dismay.
\v 34 When he slew them, then they sought after him, they turned and sought God with diligence.
\v 35 They remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.
\v 36 But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
\v 37 Their heart was not steady with him, they were faithless to his covenant.
\v 38 But he is full of pity: he pardons sin and destroys not. Often he turns his anger away, without stirring his wrath at all.
\v 39 So he remembered that they were but flesh, breath that passes and does not return.
\v 40 But how often they rebelled in the desert, and caused him grief in the wilderness,
\v 41 tempting God again and again, provoking the Holy One of Israel.
\v 42 They did not remember his strength, nor the day he redeemed from the foe,
\v 43 how he set his signs in Egypt, in the country of Zoan his wonders.
\v 44 He turned their canals into blood, their streams undrinkable.
\v 45 He sent forth flies, which devoured them; frogs, too, which destroyed them.
\v 46 Their crops he gave to the caterpillar, and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
\v 47 He slew their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
\v 48 He delivered their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to bolts of fire.
\v 49 He let loose his hot anger among them, fury and wrath and distress, a band of destroying angels.
\v 50 He cleared a path for his anger, did not spare them from death, but gave them over to pestilence.
\v 51 He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
\v 52 He led forth his people like sheep, he was guide to his flock in the desert.
\v 53 Securely he led them, and free from fear, while their foes were drowned in the sea.
\v 54 To his holy realm he brought them, to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
\v 55 He drove out the nations before them, and allotted their land for possession, and their tents for Israel to live in.
\v 56 Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God, they did not observe his decrees.
\v 57 They drew back, false like their ancestors; they failed like a treacherous bow.
\v 58 Their shrines stirred him to anger, their idols moved him to jealousy.
\v 59 When God heard of this, he was furious, and he spurned Israel utterly.
\v 60 He abandoned his home in Shiloh, the tent he had pitched among people.
\v 61 He gave his strength up to captivity, his glory to the hands of the foe.
\v 62 He gave his people to the sword, he was furious with his own.
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men, and their maidens had no marriage-song.
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep.
\v 65 Then the LORD awoke as from sleep, like a warrior flushed with wine;
\v 66 and he beat back his foes, putting them to perpetual scorn.
\v 67 He disowned the tent of Joseph, he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;
\v 68 but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.
\v 69 And he built like the heights his sanctuary, like the earth which he founded forever.
\v 70 And he chose David his servant, taking him from the sheepfolds.
\v 71 From the mother-ewes he brought him, to be shepherd to Jacob his people, and to Israel his inheritance.
\v 72 With upright heart did he shepherd them, and with skilful hands did he guide them.

Psalm 79 – A National Prayer for DeliveranceA psalm of Asaph.
\v 1 Heathen, O God, have come into your land, defiling your holy temple, and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
\v 2 They have given the bodies of your dead servantsto the birds of the air to devour, and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
\v 3 Round about Jerusalemthey have poured out their blood like water; and there was no one to bury them.
\v 4 On every side our neighborsrevile us and mock us and jeer at us.
\v 5 How long will you be angry, O LORD? Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
\v 6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
\v 7 For Jacob they devoured, they have desolated his home.
\v 8 Do not remember against us our ancestors’ sins; O meet us soon with your pity, for utterly weak are we.
\v 9 Help us, O God our savior, for the renown of your name: for your reputation deliver usand cover over our sins.
\v 10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servantsbe shown on the heathen before our eyes.
\v 11 May the groans of the prisoner come before you; free the children of death by your mighty arm.
\v 12 Pay our neighbors back sevenfoldfor the scorn they have heaped upon you, O LORD.
\v 13 Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you for evermore, and tell your praise to all generations.

Psalm 80 – A Prayer for the Preservation of IsraelFor the leader. On shoshannim, eduth. Of Asaph, a psalm.
\v 1 Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock of sheep; from your throne on the cherubs shine forth
\v 2 before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin. Stir up your mighty power, come to our help.
\v 3 God, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
\v 4 O LORD of hosts, how long is your anger to smoke, despite the prayer of your people?
\v 5 You have fed them with bread of tears, you have made them drink tears by the measure.
\v 6 The scorn of our neighbors you make us, the laughing-stock of our foes.
\v 7 God of hosts, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
\v 8 A vine out of Egypt you brought; you did drive out the nations, and plant her;
\v 9 in the ground you did clear she struck root, and she filled all the land.
\v 10 The shade of her covered the mountains, her branches the cedars of God.
\v 11 She sent forth her shoots to the sea, and her branches as far as the River.
\v 12 Why have you torn down her fences, and left herto be plucked at by all who pass by,
\v 13 to be gnawed by the boar from the forest, and devoured by the beasts of the field?
\v 14 O God of hosts, return: look down from heaven and seeand visit this vine, and restore her
\v 15 the vine which your right hand has planted.
\v 16 She is burned with fire and cut downbefore your stern face they are perishing.
\v 17 Support the one you have chosen, the one you have raised for yourself;
\v 18 then from you we will never draw back. Preserve us, and we will call on your name.
\v 19 LORD, God of hosts, restore us: Show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.

\v 2 Raise a song, sound the timbrel, sweet lyre and harp.
\v 3 On the new moon blow the horn, at the full moon, the day of our festival.
\v 4 For this is a statute for Israel, a ruling of the God of Jacob,
\v 5 a witness he set up in Joseph, when he marched against Egypt’s land, where he heard an unknown voice say:
\v 6 “I removed from your shoulder the burden, and freed your hands from the basket.
\v 7 At your call of distress I delivered you, from the thundercloud I answered you. At Meribah’s waters I tested you. Selah
\v 8 “Listen, my people, to my warning, O Israel, if you would but listen!
\v 9 There must not be a strange god among you, you must bow to no foreign god.
\v 10 I am the LORD your Godwho brought you up out of Egypt. Open your mouth, that I fill it.
\v 11 “But my people did not listen to my voice, Israel would have none of me.
\v 12 So to their own hard hearts I left them, to follow their own devices.
\v 13 O that my people would listen, that Israel would walk in my ways.
\v 14 Soon would I humble their enemies, and turn my hand on their foes.
\v 15 Those who hate the LORD would cringe before himin everlasting terror.
\v 16 But you would I feed with the richest wheat, and with honey from the rock to your heart’s desire.”

\v 3 laying crafty plans for your people, and plotting against those you treasure.
\v 4 “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation, so Israel’s name will be mentioned no more.”
\v 5 For, conspiring with one accord, they have made a league against you
\v 6 Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagrites.
\v 7 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre;
\v 8 Syria, too, is confederate, they have strengthened the children of Lot. Selah
\v 9 Deal with them as you dealt with Midian, with Sisera, with Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
\v 10 who at Endor were destroyed, and became dung for the field.
\v 11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
\v 12 who said, “Let us take for ourselvesthe meadows of God.”
\v 13 Whirl them, my God, like dust, like stubble before the wind.
\v 14 As the fire that kindles the forest, as flame that sets mountains ablaze,
\v 15 so with your tempest pursue them, terrify them with your hurricane.

Psalm 88 – The Prayer of DespairA Song, a psalm of the Korahites. To the leader: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.
\v 1 O LORD my God, I cry for help in the day-time, in the night my cry is before you;
\v 2 let my prayer come into your presence, incline your ear to my cry.
\v 3 For I am sated with sorrow, my life draws near to Sheol.
\v 4 I am counted with those who go down to the pit; without strength am I.
\v 5 My home is among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you remember no morecut off as they are from your hand.
\v 6 In the deepest pit you have put me, in shadows deep and dark.
\v 7 Your wrath lies heavy upon me, waves of your anger roll over me. Selah
\v 8 You have put my friends far from me, you have made them shun me. I am shut in, and cannot escape,
\v 9 my eyes are wasted with sorrow. I call on you, LORD, every day, spreading my hands out to you.
\v 10 For the dead can you work wonders? Can the shades rise again to praise you? Selah
\v 11 Can your kindness be told in the grave, your faithfulness in the tomb?
\v 12 Can your wonders be known in the darkness, or your help in the land of forgetfulness?
\v 13 I cry for help to you, in the morning my prayer comes before you.
\v 14 Why, O LORD, do you spurn me, and hide your face from me?
\v 15 From my youth I am wretched and dying, I am numbed by the terrors I bear.
\v 16 The fires of your wrath have passed over me, your terrors destroy me,
\v 17 surging around me forever, hemming me in altogether.
\v 18 Those who love me you put far from me; the dark is my only friend.

\v 8 O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you? Your strength and faithfulness, LORD, surround you.
\v 9 You are the LORD of the raging sea: when its waves surge, it is you who still them.
\v 10 It was you who did pierce and crush Rahab in pieces, and scatter your foes by your mighty arm.
\v 11 Yours are the heavens, yours also the earth, the world and its fulness, it’s you who did found them.
\v 12 The north and the south, it’s you have created them; Tabor and Hermon shout praise to your name.
\v 13 You have an arm with the might of a hero; strong is your hand, high uplifted your right hand.
\v 14 Justice and right are the base of your throne, kindness and faithfulness ever attend you.
\v 15 Happy the people who know the glad shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face.
\v 16 They exult in your name all the day, and your righteousness they extol.
\v 17 For you are our strength and our pride. Your favor will lift us to honor.
\v 18 For the holy LORD of Israelkeeps our defender and king.
\v 19 In a vision of old you did speakin this way to the one whom you loved: “A crown I have set on the heroI chose to be over the people
\v 20 “I found my servant David, and anointed with holy oil.
\v 21 My hand will be with him forever, my arm will give him strength.
\v 22 “No enemy will dare to assail him, nor the wicked to oppress him;
\v 23 but his foes I will shatter before him, I will strike down those who hate him.
\v 24 “My loyal love shall attend him, and I will lift him to honor.
\v 25 I will set his hand on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.
\v 26 “As for him, he will call me ‘My father, my God, and my rock of salvation.’
\v 27 And I will make him my firstborn, highest of kings on the earth.
\v 28 “My love will I keep for him ever, my covenant with him shall stand fast.
\v 29 His line will I make everlasting, and his throne as the days of the heavens.
\v 30 “If his children forsake my law, and walk not as I have ordained;
\v 31 if they profane my statutes, and do not keep my commandments;
\v 32 “I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with scourges.
\v 33 But my love will I not take from him, nor will I belie my faithfulness.
\v 34 “I will not profane my covenantby changing the word that has passed my lips.
\v 35 Once have I solemnly swornand I would not lie to David,
\v 36 “that his line should endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me,
\v 37 firm as the moon which for everand ever is fixed in the sky.” Selah
\v 38 But you have cast off in contempt, and been furious with your anointed.
\v 39 You have spurned the covenant with your servant, and his sacred crown dashed to the ground.
\v 40 You have broken down all his walls, and laid his bulwarks in ruins.
\v 41 All who pass on their way despoil him, the scorn of his neighbors is he now.
\v 42 You have given his foes the victory, and made all his enemies glad.
\v 43 You have turned back his sword from the foe, you did not lift him up in the battle.
\v 44 The sceptre you took from his hand, and his throne you did hurl to the ground.
\v 45 You have shortened the days of his youth, and covered him with shame. Selah
\v 46 How long, LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long are the fires of your wrath to burn?
\v 47 Remember, LORD, the shortness of lifehow fleeting you made all people.
\v 48 Who can live without seeing death? Who can rescue their life from the clutch of Sheol? Selah
\v 49 Where, LORD, is your kindness of old, which you in your faithfulness swore to David?
\v 50 Remember, O LORD, how your servants are mocked, how I bear in my heart the scorn of all nations
\v 51 The scorn which your enemies hurl, O LORD, which they hurl at the footsteps of your anointed.
\v 52 Blest be the Lord, for ever and ever.Amen and Amen.

Book FourPsalm 90 – Hymn of EternityA prayer of Moses, the man of God.
\v 1 LORD, you have been a home to usone generation after another.
\v 2 Before the mountains were born, or the earth and the world were brought forth, from everlasting to everlastingyou are God.
\v 3 You bring us back to the dust, you summon mortals to return.
\v 4 For you see a thousand yearsas the passing of yesterday, as a watch in the night.
\v 5 Your floods sweep them away; they are like a dream, or like grass which sprouts in the morning,
\v 6 which blossoms and sprouts in the morning, but by evening is cut and withered.
\v 7 For your anger consumes us, the heat of your wrath confounds us.
\v 8 Our sins you have set before you, our secrets in the light of your face.
\v 9 For through your wrath our days are declining, we bring our years to an end as a sigh.
\v 10 The span of our life is seventy years, or, if we are strong, maybe eighty; yet is their breadth but empty toil, for swiftly they go, and we fly away.
\v 11 Who lays to heart the power of your anger? Or who stands in reverent awe of your wrath?
\v 12 O teach us to count our daysso our minds may learn wisdom.
\v 13 Return, O LORD; why so long? Relent on your servants.
\v 14 Grant us your love to the full in the morning, that all our days we may shout for joy.
\v 15 Make us glad for the days you have humbled us, for the evil years we have seen.
\v 16 Let your servants see you in action, show your majesty to their children.
\v 17 Let the grace of the LORD our God be upon us, uphold what our hands are striving to do.

Psalm 91 – In the Shelter of the Most HighRevision 2
\v 1 You whose home is the shelter of God Most High, whose abode is the shadow of God Almighty,
\v 2 can say to the LORD, “My refuge, my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”
\v 3 For he saves you from fowler’s snare, from deadly plague,
\v 4 he shelters you with his pinions, and under his wings you can hide. His truth will be a shield and buckler.
\v 5 You need not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
\v 6 nor the plague that stalks in darkness, nor the pestilence raging at noon.
\v 7 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand: but it will not draw near to you.
\v 8 You will only look on with your eyes, and see how the wicked are punished.
\v 9 You have made the LORD your refuge, you have made the Most High your defence.
\v 10 You will never be met by misfortune, no plague will come near your tent,
\v 11 for he orders his angels to guard you, wherever you go.
\v 12 They will carry you with their hands, so you don’t hurt your foot on a stone.
\v 13 You will trample down lions and snakes, tread on young lions and cobras.
\v 14 “Because of their love for me, I will deliver them, I will protect those who trust my name.
\v 15 I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble, bringing them forth into safety and honor.
\v 16 I will give them a life of many days, I will show them my salvation.”

Psalm 92 – The Ways of GodA psalm. A song; for the sabbath day.
\v 1 It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
\v 2 to declare your love in the morning, and your faithfulness in the night,
\v 3 with voice and a ten-stringed harp, with music that throbs on the lyre.
\v 4 For you make me glad by your deeds, LORD, at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.
\v 5 How great are your works, O LORD; how deep are your thoughts!
\v 6 The insensitive cannot know, nor can a fool understand,
\v 7 that, though the wicked flourish like grass, and evildoers all blossom, they will perish forever.
\v 8 But you are exalted forever.
\v 9 For see! Your enemies, LORDFor see! Your enemies perish, all evildoers are scattered.
\v 10 But you lift me to honor, and anoint me afresh with oil.
\v 11 My eyes will feast on my foes, and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.
\v 12 The righteous will sprout like the palm, will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
\v 13 In the house of the LORD are they planted, in the courts of our God they will sprout.
\v 14 They will still bear fruit in old age, all sappy and fresh will they be
\v 15 So they proclaim the LORD to be just, my rock, in whom is no wrong.

\v 3 The floods, O LORD, have lifted, the floods have lifted their voice, the floods lift up their roar.

Psalm 94 – A Prayer for Vengeance on the Cruel
\v 1 LORD, God of vengeance, God of vengeance, shine forth.
\v 2 Rise up, judge of the earth, pay back the proud what they deserve.
\v 3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult,
\v 4 with their blustering arrogant words, their braggart and wicked speech,
\v 5 crushing your people, LORD, and afflicting your heritage,
\v 6 murdering widows and strangers, slaying the fatherless?
\v 7 They think that the LORD does not see, nor the God of Jacob regard it.
\v 8 Take heed, you dullest of people; when will you be wise, you fools?
\v 9 Is he deaf, who shaped the ear? Is he blind, who fashioned the eye?
\v 10 Can he who trains nations not punish themhe who teaches knowledge to people?
\v 11 The LORD knows the thoughts of people, that only a breath are they.
\v 12 Happy are those whom you chasten, and teach out of your law,
\v 13 keeping them calm in the day of misfortune, till a pit be dug for the wicked.
\v 14 For the LORD will not leave his people, he will not forsake his inheritance.
\v 15 For the righteous shall come to their rights, and all true-hearted people shall follow them.
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against those who do evil? Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong?
\v 17 Were it not for the help of the LORD, I would soon have gone to the silent grave.
\v 18 When I thought that my foot was slipping, your kindness, LORD, held me up.
\v 19 When with cares my heart was crowded, your comforts make me glad.
\v 20 Can corrupt justice be your ally, framing mischief by statute?
\v 21 They assail the life of the righteous, and innocent blood condemn.
\v 22 But the LORD is my sure retreat, my God is the rock of my refuge.
\v 23 He will bring back their sin upon them, for their wickedness he will destroy them; the LORD our God will destroy them.

\v 9 when your ancestors tempted and tried me, though they had seen my deeds.
\v 10 “For forty years I was filled with loathingfor that generation, so I said:‘A people with wandering hearts are they, and ignorant of my ways.’
\v 11 So I solemnly swore to them in my anger, that never would they enter my place of rest.”

Psalm 102 – A Prayer for Pity and for the Restoration of ZionThe prayer: for a weary and suffering person who pours out their grief to the LORD.
\v 1 Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come to you.
\v 2 Hide not your face from mein the day of my distress. Incline your ear to me: when I call, answer me speedily.
\v 3 For my days pass away like smoke: my bones are burned through as with fire.
\v 4 My heart is scorched, withered like grass; I forget to eat my bread.
\v 5 By reason of my loud groaning, my flesh clings to my bones.
\v 6 Like a desert-owl of the wilderness, like an owl among ruins am I.
\v 7 I make my sleepless lamentlike a bird on the house-top alone.
\v 8 All the day wild foes revile me, using my name for a curse.
\v 9 For ashes have been my bread, and tears have been mixed with my cup.
\v 10 Because of your passionate anger, you did raise me, then hurl me to the ground.
\v 11 My days come to an end, shadows lengthen, I wither like grass.
\v 12 But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever, your fame endures to all generations.
\v 13 You will arise and have pity on Zion; it’s time to be gracious; her hour has come.
\v 14 For even her stones are dear to your servants, even the dust of her ruins they look on with love.
\v 15 Then the nations will revere the name of the LORDand all the kings of the earth his glory,
\v 16 when the LORD shall have built up Zion, and revealed himself in his glory,
\v 17 in response to the prayer of the destitute, whose prayer he will not despise.
\v 18 Let this be recorded for ages to come, that the LORD may be praised by a people yet unborn.
\v 19 For he shall look down from his holy height, from the heavens the LORD will gaze on the earth,
\v 20 to hear the groans of the prisoner, to free those who are doomed to die;
\v 21 that people may recount the LORD’s fame in Zion, and the praise of him in Jerusalem,
\v 22 when the nations are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to worship the LORD.
\v 23 He has broken my strength on the way, he has shortened my days.
\v 24 I will say, “My God, take me not hencein the midst of my days. “Your years endure age after age.
\v 25 Of old you have founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
\v 26 They shall perish; but you do stand. They shall all wax old like a garment, and change as a robe you will change them.
\v 27 But you are the same, your years are endless.
\v 28 The children of your servants abide, evermore shall their seed be before you.”

Psalm 103 – Bless the Lord, O my SoulOf David.
\v 1 O my soul, bless the LORD; and all that is in me, his holy name.
\v 2 O my soul, bless the LORD; and forget not one of his benefits.
\v 3 He pardons all your sins, he heals all your diseases.
\v 4 He ransoms your life from the pit, he crowns you with kindness and pity.
\v 5 He gives you your heart’s desire, renewing your youth like the eagle’s.
\v 6 The LORD executes justice –and right for all who are wronged.
\v 7 He revealed his ways to Moses, his acts to the children of Israel.
\v 8 Full of pity and grace is the LORD, patient, and rich in kindness:
\v 9 he will not always chide, nor cherish his anger forever.
\v 10 Not after our sins has he dealt with us, nor requited us after our wickedness.
\v 11 For high as the heavens o’er the earthis his love over those who revere him.
\v 12 Far as is east from the westhas he put our transgressions from us.
\v 13 As a father pities his children, so the LORD pities those who revere him;
\v 14 for well he knows our frame, he remembers that we are dust.
\v 15 A person’s days are as grass; blossoms like a flower of the meadow.
\v 16 At the breath of the wind it is gone, and the place thereof knows it no more.
\v 17 But the love of the LORD is eternal, and his kindness to children’s children,
\v 18 to those who keep his covenantand mindfully do his behests.
\v 19 The LORD has set his throne in the heavens; the whole world is under his sway.
\v 20 Bless the LORD, you angels of his, mighty heroes performing his word.
\v 21 Bless the LORD, all you his hosts, you servants who do his will.

Psalm 104 – The Hymn of Creation
\v 1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great, clad in awful splendor,
\v 2 covered with robe of light. You stretch out the heavens like the cloth of a tent.
\v 3 He lays the beams of his chambers on water. He takes dark clouds for his chariot, and rides on the wings of the wind.
\v 4 He takes the winds for his messengers, the fire and the flame for his servants.
\v 5 He founded the earth upon pillars, to sustain it unshaken forever.
\v 6 With the garment of ocean he covered it, waters towered over the mountains.
\v 7 But at your rebuke they fled, scared by the roar of your thunder,
\v 8 mountains rose, valleys sank downto the place appointed for them.
\v 9 They dared not pass the bounds set for them, or cover the earth any more.
\v 10 He sent brooks into the valleys, they meander between the mountains.
\v 11 The wild beasts all drink from them, and the wild asses quench their thirst.
\v 12 The birds have their home by the banks, and sing in the branches.
\v 13 From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains, and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven.
\v 14 He makes grass grow for the cattle, and herbs for people. He brings bread out of the earth;
\v 15 wine, to gladden hearts; oil, to make faces shine; bread, to strengthen hearts.
\v 16 The trees of the LORD drink their fillthe cedars he planted on Lebanon,
\v 17 where the little birds build their nest, and the stork whose home is the cypress.
\v 18 The high hills are for the wild goats, and the rocks are for coneys to hide in.
\v 19 He created the moon to mark seasons, and told the sun when to set.
\v 20 You make it dark: night comes, when all the wild beasts creep out.
\v 21 Young lions that roar for their prey, seeking their meat from God.
\v 22 At sunrise they slink away, and lie down in their dens.
\v 23 Then people go forth to their work, and toil till evening.
\v 24 How many, O LORD, are your works, all of them made in wisdom! The earth is filled with your creatures.
\v 25 And there is the great broad sea, where are countless things in motion, living creatures, both great and small.
\v 26 There go the ships, and the Leviathan you made to play there.
\v 27 They all look in hope to you, to give them their food in due season.
\v 28 And you give with open hand; they gather and eat to their heart’s desire.
\v 29 When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take their breath away, they die and go back to their dust.
\v 30 But a breath from your lips creates them, and renews the face of the earth.
\v 31 May the glory of the LORD be forever, may the LORD rejoice in his works.
\v 32 A glance of his makes the earth tremble, a touch of his makes the hills smoke.
\v 33 I will sing to the LORD while I live, I will play to my God while I am.
\v 34 May my musing be sweet to him, for I rejoice in the LORD.
\v 35 But may sinners be swept from the earth, and the wicked vanish forever. O my soul, bless the LORD. Hallelujah.

Psalm 105 – The Inspiration of the Past
\v 1 Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name: make known his deeds among the nations.
\v 2 Sing to him, make music to him, tell of all his wondrous works.
\v 3 Make your boast in his holy name, be glad at heart, you who seek the LORD.
\v 4 Seek after the LORD and his strength, seek his face evermore.
\v 5 Remember the wonders he did, his portents, the judgments he uttered,
\v 6 you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant, the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\v 7 He is the LORD our God: in all the earth are his judgments.
\v 8 He remembers forever his covenant, his promise for a thousand generations
\v 9 The covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac,
\v 10 and confirmed as a statute to Jacob, a pact everlasting to Israel
\v 11 to give them the land of Canaanas the lot which they should inherit.
\v 12 And when they were very few, few and but pilgrims therein,
\v 13 wandering from nation to nation, journeying from people to people,
\v 14 he allowed no one to oppress them, even punishing kings for their sakes.
\v 15 He forbade them to touch his anointed, or do any hurt to his prophets.
\v 16 When he called down famine on the land, and cut off the bread which sustained them,
\v 17 he sent before them a man, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
\v 18 His feet were galled with fetters, he was laid in chains of iron,
\v 19 till the time that his word came to pass, the word of the LORD that had tried him.
\v 20 The king sent and freed him, the ruler of nations released him.
\v 21 He made him lord of his household, and ruler of all his possessions,
\v 22 to admonish his princes at willand instruct his elders in wisdom.
\v 23 Thus Israel came into Egypt, Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
\v 24 His people he made very fruitful, and mightier than their foes.
\v 25 He inspired them to hate his people, and to deal with his servants craftily.
\v 26 He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron whom he had chosen,
\v 27 portents he wrought in Egypt, and signs in the land of Ham.
\v 28 Darkness he sent, and it fell: yet they gave no heed to his word.
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, thus causing their fish to die.
\v 30 Their land was alive with frogs, swarming even in the royal chambers.
\v 31 At his command came flies, and lice in all their borders.
\v 32 He gave them hail for rainand fire that flashed through the land,
\v 33 smiting their vines and figs, breaking the trees of their border.
\v 34 At his command came locusts, young locusts beyond all counting,
\v 35 which ate every herb in the land, ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
\v 36 He struck down in their land all the firstborn, the firstlings of all their strength
\v 37 Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold, and among his tribes no one was weary.
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they left, for terror had fallen upon them.
\v 39 He spread out a cloud to screen them, and fire to give light in the night.
\v 40 He sent quails at their entreaty, and heavenly bread in abundance.
\v 41 He opened the rock; waters gushed: in the desert they ran like a river.
\v 42 For he remembered his holy promiseto Abraham his servant.
\v 43 So he led out his people with joy, his elect with a ringing cry.

Psalm 106 – The Nation’s Sin against the Lord
\v 1 Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness, for his kindness endures forever.
\v 2 Who can describe his heroic deeds, or publish all his praise?
\v 3 Happy they who act justly, and do righteousness evermore.
\v 4 Remember me, LORD, as you remember your people, and visit me with your gracious help.
\v 5 May I see the good fortune of your elect, may I share in the joy of your nation, and in the pride of your heritage.
\v 6 We, like our fathers, have sinned, we have done perversely and wickedly
\v 7 In the land of Egypt our fathers, all heedless of your wonders, and unmindful of your great kindness, at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
\v 8 But true to his name he saved them, in order to show his might.
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried; they marched through the depths as through desert,
\v 10 saved from the hand of the hostile, redeemed from the hand of the foe.
\v 11 The waters covered their enemies: not one of them was left.
\v 12 So then they believed in his words, and began to sing his praise.
\v 13 But soon they forgot his deeds: they did not wait for his counsel.
\v 14 Their greed was ravenous in the desert; they put God to the test in the wilderness.
\v 15 He gave them the thing they had asked for, but sent wasting disease among them.
\v 16 The camp grew jealous of Mosesand of Aaron, holy one of the LORD.
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered Abiram’s company.
\v 18 Fire broke out on their company, flame kindled upon the wicked.
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed to the molten image.
\v 20 They exchanged their glorious Godfor the image of an ox that eats grass.
\v 21 They forgot the God who had saved themby mighty deeds in Egypt
\v 22 Wonders in the land of Ham, terrors by the Red Sea.
\v 23 So he vowed, and would have destroyed them, but for Moses his elect, who stepped into the breach before him, to divert his deadly wrath.
\v 24 They spurned the delightsome land, they refused to believe in his word.
\v 25 They grumbled in their tents, would not listen to the voice of the LORD.
\v 26 So he swore with uplifted handto lay them low in the wilderness;
\v 27 to disperse their seed among heathen, to scatter them over the world.
\v 28 Then they joined them to Baal of Peor, and ate what was offered the dead.
\v 29 They provoked him to wrath by their deeds, and plague broke out among them.
\v 30 Then Phinehas stood between, and so the plague was stayed;
\v 31 and it was counted to him for righteousnessunto all generations forever.
\v 32 They angered him at the waters of Meribah, through them it went ill with Moses.
\v 33 They rebelled against his spirit, and he uttered speech that was rash.
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations, as the LORD had commanded them;
\v 35 but they mingled with the heathen, and learned to do as they did.
\v 36 Their idol gods they worshipped, and they were ensnared by them.
\v 37 They sacrificed their sonsand their daughters to the demons.
\v 38 They poured out innocent bloodthe blood of their sons and daughterswhom they offered to Canaan’s idols, and the land was polluted with blood.
\v 39 They became unclean by their works, and adulterous in their deeds.
\v 40 Then the LORD’s fury was on his people, filled with horror at his inheritance.
\v 41 He delivered them to the heathen, to the sway of those who hated them.
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them, and subdued them under their hand.
\v 43 Many a time he saved them, but they rebelled at his counsel, and were brought low by their wrongdoing.
\v 44 Yet he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.
\v 45 He remembered his covenant, and, in his great kindness, relented.
\v 46 He caused them to be pitiedby all who carried them captive.
\v 47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us out of the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, and to make our boast of your praise.
\v 48 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,from everlasting to everlasting.And let all the people say “Amen.”Praise the Lord.

Book FivePsalm 107 – The Song of the Redeemed
\v 1 Give thanks to the LORD for his goodnessfor his kindness endures forever.
\v 2 Let this be the song of the ransomed, whom the LORD has redeemed from distress,
\v 3 gathering them from all lands, east, west, north, and south.
\v 4 In the wastes of the desert some wandered, finding no way to a city inhabited.
\v 5 Full of hunger and thirst, their spirit failed.
\v 6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses,
\v 7 guiding them straight on the way, till they reached an inhabited city.
\v 8 Let them thank the LORD for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people;
\v 9 for the thirsty he satisfies, and the hungry he fills with good things.
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and gloomprisoners in irons and misery,
\v 11 for rebelling against God’s word, and spurning the Most High’s counsel.
\v 12 Their heart was bowed with toil; there was no one to help when they stumbled.
\v 13 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
\v 14 Out of darkness and gloom he brought them, and burst their chains.
\v 15 Let them praise the LORD for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
\v 16 For he shattered the gates of bronze, and broke bars of iron.
\v 17 Some were sick from their wicked ways, and suffering because of their sins.
\v 18 All manner of food they hated; they had come to the gates of death.
\v 19 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
\v 20 He sent his word and healed them, and delivered their life from the pit.
\v 21 Let them praise the LORD for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
\v 22 Let them offer to him thankofferings, and with joy tell what things he has done.
\v 23 Some crossed the sea in ships, doing business in great waters.
\v 24 They have seen what the LORD can do, and his wonderful deeds on the deep.
\v 25 At his command rose a tempest, which lifted the waves on high.
\v 26 Up to heaven they went, down to the depths; their courage failed them.
\v 27 They staggered and reeled like drunkards; all their skills useless.
\v 28 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
\v 29 He stilled the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
\v 30 They were glad, because it was quiet; they were led to the haven they longed for.
\v 31 Let them praise the LORD, for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
\v 32 Where the people assemble, extol him, and praise him in council of elders.
\v 33 He turns streams into a wilderness, springs of water into thirsty land,
\v 34 fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the sin of the people.
\v 35 A desert he makes pools of water, a land of drought into springs of water.
\v 36 He settles the hungry therein, they establish a city to live in.
\v 37 They sow fields and plant vineyards, which furnish a fruitful yield.
\v 38 By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he lets not their cattle decrease.
\v 39 Yet when they are bowed and diminishedby oppression, misfortune, or sorrow,
\v 40 he pours contempt upon princes, and on trackless wastes leads them astray
\v 41 He lifts the poor out of misery, and makes families fruitful as flocks.
\v 42 At this sight shall the upright be glad, and all wicked mouths shall be stopped.
\v 43 Let those who are wise observe this, and consider the love of the LORD

Psalm 108 – A Prayer for VictoryA song. A psalm of David.
\v 1 My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music; awake, my soul.
\v 2 Awake, harp and lyre; I would wake the dawn.
\v 3 I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD; make music among the nations to you.
\v 4 For great to heaven is your love, and your faithfulness to the clouds.
\v 5 Be exalted, O God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.
\v 6 So those you love may be rescued, save by your right hand and answer us.
\v 7 God did solemnly swear: “As victor will I divide Shechem, portion out the valley of Succoth.
\v 8 Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh, Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my sceptre of rule,
\v 9 Moab the pot that I wash in, on Edom I hurl my sandal, I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.”
\v 10 O to be brought to the fortified city! O to be led into Edom!
\v 11 Have you not spurned us, O God? You do not march forth with our armies.
\v 12 Grant us help from the foe, for human help is worthless.
\v 13 With God we shall yet do bravely, he himself will tread down our foes.

Psalm 109 – A Prayer for the Lord’s HelpFor the leader. Of David, a psalm.
\v 1 O God whom I praise, keep not silence;
\v 2 for their wicked mouths they have opened against me, they speak to me with tongues that are false,
\v 3 they beset me with words of hatred, and fight without cause against me.
\v 4 My love they requite with hostility, while for them I lift up my prayer.
\v 5 Evil for good they reward me, and hatred for my love.
\v 6 “Set over him one who is godless,” they say, “an opponent at his right hand.
\v 7 From his trial let him come forth guilty, may his prayer be counted as sin.
\v 8 Grant that his days may be few, that his office be seized by another.
\v 9 Grant that his children be fatherless, and that his wife be a widow.
\v 10 Up and down may his children go begging, expelled from their desolate home.
\v 11 May all that he owns be seized by the creditormay strangers plunder the fruits of his toil.
\v 12 “May none extend to him kindness, or pity his fatherless children.
\v 13 His descendants be doomed to destruction! Blotted out be his name in one generation!
\v 14 May his father’s guilt be remembered, and his mother’s sin not blotted out:
\v 15 on record always before the LORD, and his memory root from the earth;
\v 16 for he gave no thought to show kindness, but pursued the poor and the needy, drove the downhearted to death.
\v 17 “May the curses he loved light upon him, may the blessings he loathed be afar.
\v 18 Like a garment he clothed him with curses; may they pierce to his inwards like water, and cling to his bones like oil.
\v 19 Let them be like the robe he wraps round him, like the belt he wears every day.”
\v 20 Be this the reward of my adversaries, of those who speak evil against me.
\v 21 But you, LORD my GOD, be true to your name, deal kindly with me; in your gracious kindnesssave me.
\v 22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
\v 23 I am gone like a lengthening shadow, I am shaken off like a locust.
\v 24 My knees totter from fasting, my flesh is shrivelled and spare.
\v 25 They heap insults upon me: when they see me, they shake their head.
\v 26 Help me, O LORD my God, and save me in your kindness.
\v 27 Teach them that this is your hand, and your own doing, O LORD.
\v 28 Let them curse, if only you bless. Put my assailants to shame, and make your servant glad.
\v 29 My opponents be clothed with dishonor, and wrapped in a robe of shame.
\v 30 I give thanks to you, LORD, with loud voice, I give praise in the midst of the throng;
\v 31 for he stands by the poor, at his right hand, to save them from those who condemn them.

\v 5 They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see.
\v 6 They have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell.
\v 7 They have hands, but cannot feel; they have feet, but cannot walk: no sound comes from their throats.

\v 10 House of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.

\v 14 May the LORD add to your numbersto you and to your children.
\v 15 Blessed be you of the LORD, creator of heaven and earth.
\v 16 The heavens are the heavens of the LORD, but the earth has he given to people.

\v 5 Gracious and just is the LORD, compassionate is our God.
\v 6 The LORD preserves the simple; when I was drooping, he saved me.
\v 7 Be at peace, my heart, once more, for the LORD has been good to you.
\v 8 You have rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
\v 9 Before the LORD I will walkin the land of the living.
\v 10 I held fast my faith, though I said, “Ah me! I am sore afflicted,”
\v 11 though in my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.”

\v 13 I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the LORD.
\v 14 I will pay my vows to the LORDin the presence of all his people.
\v 15 Grave in the eyes of the LORDis the death of his loyal and loved ones.

\v 84 How few are the days of your servant! When will you judge those who harass me?
\v 85 Proud people have dug for me pitspeople who do not conform to your law.
\v 86 All your commandments are trusty. With falsehood they harass me: help me.
\v 87 They had nearly made an end of me, yet I did not forget your precepts.
\v 88 Spare me in your kindness, and I will observe the charge of your mouth.
\v 89 Forever, O LORD, is your wordfixed firmly in the heavens.
\v 90 Your truth endures age after age; it is established on earth, and it stands.

\v 99 I am prudent above all my teachers, for your charges are my meditation.
\v 100 I have insight more than the aged, because I observe your precepts.
\v 101 I refrain my foot from all wicked ways, that I may keep your word.
\v 102 I turn not aside from your judgments, for you yourself are my teacher.
\v 103 How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
\v 104 Insight I win through your precepts, therefore every false way I hate.
\v 105 Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path.

\v 108 Accept, LORD, my willing praise, and teach me your judgments.
\v 109 My life is in ceaseless peril; but I do not forget your law.
\v 110 The wicked set traps for me, yet I do not stray from your precepts.

\v 117 Hold me up, and I shall be saved: and your statutes shall be my unceasing delight.
\v 118 All who swerve from your statutes you spurn: their cunning is in vain.
\v 119 All the wicked of earth you count as dross, therefore I love your charges.
\v 120 In awe of you, my body trembles, I fear your judgments.
\v 121 Justice and right have I practised, do not leave me to my oppressors.
\v 122 Be your servant’s surety for good, let not the proud oppress me.
\v 123 My eyes pine for your salvation, and for your righteous promise.
\v 124 Deal in your love with your servant, and teach me your statutes.
\v 125 Your servant am I; instruct me, that I may know your charges.
\v 126 It is time for the LORD to act: they have violated your law.
\v 127 Therefore I love your commandmentsabove gold, above fine gold.
\v 128 So I guide my life by your precepts, and every false way I hate.
\v 129 Your decrees are wonderful, gladly I keep them.
\v 130 When your word is unfolded, light breaks; imparting wisdom to the simple.
\v 131 With open mouth I pantwith longing for your commandments.
\v 132 Turn to me with your favor, as is just to those who love you.
\v 133 Steady my steps by your word, so that sin have no power over me.
\v 134 Set me free from those who oppress me, and I shall observe your precepts.
\v 135 Shine with your face on your servant, and teach me your statutes.

\v 137 Righteous are you, O LORD, and right are your ordinances.
\v 138 The laws you has ordered are just, and trusty exceedingly.

\v 140 Your word has been tested well; and your servant loves it.
\v 141 I am little and held in contempt, but your precepts I have not forgotten.
\v 142 Just is your justice forever, and trusty is your law.
\v 143 Stress and strain are upon me, but your commandments are my delight.
\v 144 Right are your charges forever, instruct me that I may live.
\v 145 With my whole heart I cry; O answer me. I would keep your statutes, O LORD.
\v 146 I cry to you: O save me, and I will observe your charges.
\v 147 Before dawn I cry for your help: in your word do I hope.
\v 148 Awake I meet the night-watches, to muse upon your sayings.
\v 149 Hear my voice in your kindness: O LORD, by your judgments revive me.
\v 150 Near me are wicked tormentors, who are far from thoughts of your law;
\v 151 but near, too, are you, O LORD, and all your commandments are trusty.
\v 152 Long have I known from your chargesthat you have founded them for all time.
\v 153 Look on my misery, and rescue me; for I do not forget your law.
\v 154 Defend my cause and redeem me: revive me, as you have promised.
\v 155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for their mind is not in your statutes.
\v 156 Great is your pity, O LORD: Revive me, as you have ordained.
\v 157 My foes and tormentors are many, but I have not declined from your charges.
\v 158 I behold the traitors with loathing, for they do not observe your word.
\v 159 Behold how I love your precepts: revive me, O LORD!, in your kindness.
\v 160 The sum of your word is truth, all your laws are just and eternal.
\v 161 Princes have harassed me wantonly: but my heart stands in awe of your word.
\v 162 Over your word I rejoiceas one who finds great spoil.
\v 163 Falsehood I hate and abhor, but your law do I love.
\v 164 Seven times a day do I praise youbecause of your righteous judgments.
\v 165 Right well do they fare who love your law: they go on their way without stumbling.
\v 166 I hope for your salvation; O LORD I do your commandments.
\v 167 I observe your charges: I love them greatly.
\v 168 I observe your precepts and charges: all my ways are before you.

\v 171 My lips shall be fountains of praise, that you teach me your statutes.
\v 172 My tongue shall sing of your word, for all your commandments are right.

\v 1 O LORD, you search and know me;

\v 3 When I walk, when I lie you sift it, familiar with all my ways.
\v 4 There is not a word on my tongue, but see! LORD, you know it all.
\v 5 Behind and before you beset me, upon me you lay your hand.
\v 6 It’s too wonderful for me to knowtoo lofty I cannot attain it.
\v 7 Whither shall I go from your spirit? Or whither shall I flee from your face?
\v 8 If I climb up to heaven, you are there: or make Sheol my bed, you are there.
\v 9 If I lift up the wings of the morningand fly to the end of the sea,
\v 10 there also your hand would grasp me, and your right hand take hold of me.
\v 11 If I say, “Let the darkness cover me, and night be the light about me,”
\v 12 The dark is not dark for you, but night is as light as the day.
\v 13 For you did put me together; in my mother’s womb you did weave me.
\v 14 I give you praise for my fashioningso full of awe, so wonderful. Your works are wonderful. You knew me right well;
\v 15 my bones were not hidden from you, when I was made in secret, and woven in the depths of the earth.
\v 16 Your eyes saw all my days: they stood on your book every onewritten down, before they were fashioned, while none of them yet was mine.
\v 17 But how far, O God, beyond measureare your thoughts! How mighty their sum!
\v 18 Should I count, they are more than the sand. When I wake, I am still with you.
\v 19 Will you slay the wicked, O God? And remove from me the bloodthirsty,
\v 20 who maliciously defy youand take your name in vain.
\v 21 Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD? Do I not loathe those who resist you?
\v 22 With perfect hatred I hate them, I count them my enemies.
\v 23 Search me, O God, know my heart: test me, and know my thoughts,
\v 24 and see if guile be in me; and lead me in the way everlasting.

\v 10 may he rain upon them coals of fire, may he strike them down swiftly, to rise no more,
\v 11 no place in the land may there be for the slanderer: may the violent be hunted from sorrow to sorrow.

\v 5 A wound or reproof from a good person in kindnessis oil which my head shall never refuse. In their misfortune my prayer is still with them.
\v 6 Abandoned they are to the hands of their judges: they shall learn that my words are true.
\v 7 Like stones on a country road cleft and brokenso lie our bones scattered for Death to devour.
\v 8 But my eyes are turned towards you, O LORD. Do not pour out my life, for in you I take refuge.
\v 9 Keep me safe from the trap they have laid for me, from the snares of the workers of trouble.
\v 10 Into their own nets let wicked people fall; while I pass by in safety.

Psalm 142 – A Prayer for Deliverance from PersecutorsA maskil of David, while he was in the cave, a prayer.
\v 1 Loudly I cry to the LORD: to the LORD plead loudly for mercy,
\v 2 I pour my complaint before him, I tell my troubles to him.
\v 3 When my spirit is faint within me, my path is known to you. In the way I am wont to walk in, they have hidden a trap for me.
\v 4 I look to the right and the left; but not a friend have I. No place of refuge is left me, not a man to care for me.
\v 5 So I cry to you, O LORD: I say, “My refuge are you, all I have in the land of the living.”
\v 6 Attend to my piercing cry, for very weak am I. Save me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.
\v 7 Free me from prison, that I may give thanks to your name, for the righteous are patiently waitingtill you show your bounty to me.

Psalm 143 – A Prayer for Deliverance and GuidanceA psalm of David.
\v 1 Listen, O LORD, to my prayer; attend to my plea. In your faithfulness give me answer, and in your righteousness.
\v 2 With your servant O enter you not into judgment, for in your sight can no one alive be justified.
\v 3 For the enemy persecutes me, crushing my life to the ground, making me live in the darkness, as those who have long been dead.
\v 4 My spirit is faint within me, my heart is bewildered within me.
\v 5 I remember the days of old, and brood over all you have done, musing on all that your hands have wrought.
\v 6 I spread out my hands to you: I thirst for you, like parched earth. Selah
\v 7 Answer me soon, LORD, because my spirit is spent. Hide not your face from me, else become I like those who go down to the pit.
\v 8 Let me learn of your love in the morning, for my trust is in you. Teach me the way I should go: for my heart longs for you.
\v 9 Save me, O LORD, from my foes: for to you I have fled for refuge.
\v 10 Teach me to do your will, for you yourself are my God. Guide me by your good spirit, O LORD, on a way that is smooth.
\v 11 Be true to your name LORD, spare me, bring me out of distress in your faithfulness.
\v 12 In your kindness extinguish my enemies, and all those who vex me destroy; for I am your servant.

Psalm 144 – The Warrior’s SongOf David.
\v 1 Blest be the LORD my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for fighting.
\v 2 My rock and my fortress, my tower, my deliverer, my shield, behind whom I take refuge, who lays nations low at my feet.
\v 3 LORD, what are mortalsthat you care for them, humans, that you think of them?
\v 4 They are like a breath, their days as a shadow that passes.
\v 5 LORD, bow your heavens and come down: touch the hills, so that they smoke.
\v 6 Flash forth lightning and scatter them, your arrows send forth and confound them.
\v 7 Stretch out your hand from on high; pluck me out of the mighty waters, out of the hands of foreigners,
\v 8 who speak with the mouth of falsehood, and lift their right hand to swear lies.
\v 9 O God, a new song I would sing you, on a ten-stringed harp make you music.
\v 10 For to kings you give the victory, and David your servant you save.
\v 11 Snatch me from the cruel sword, rescue me from the hand of foreigners, who speak with the mouth of falsehood, and lift their right hand to swear lies. The Prosperity of the Lord’s People
\v 12 May our sons in their youthbe as plants well tended: our daughters like cornicescarved as in palaces.
\v 13 May our barns be burstingwith produce of all kinds. In the fields may our sheep bearby thousands and ten thousands.
\v 14 May our cattle be fat, our walls unbreached, may no cry of distressring in our streets.
\v 15 Happy the peoplewho fares so well: and so fares the peoplewhose God is the LORD.
