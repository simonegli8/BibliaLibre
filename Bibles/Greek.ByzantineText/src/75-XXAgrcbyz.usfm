\mt2 Notes on Transcription and Corrections  
\ip This transcription of the 1904 Patriarchal Text has been compared with Maurice Robinson's collation (see Appendix B) and spellchecked to ensure accuracy. Words that appear in small type in the original 1904 printed edition indicate material lacking sufficient Greek support or weakly supported alternate readings for liturgical purposes. These have been checked against Robinson's list (see Appendix B) and are marked with brackets in this electronic edition. (The relevant portion of 1 John 5:7-8 is marked with double brackets due to its unique printed form in italicized small type.) Words that appear in \bdit bold italics\bdit* indicate Old Testament quotations. The original 1904 printed edition sets off some type with expanded character spacing for emphasis. This expanded character spacing is marked with \it italics\it* in this electronic edition. Paragraph breaks have been checked against the 1904 printed edition, but punctuation and accent marks have \it not\it* been checked against the original 1904 printed edition. Nevertheless, most problems with accent marks were corrected during the spellcheck process. The cross-references in the original 1904 printed edition are not included in this electronic edition. The original 1904 printed edition contains a number of typographical errors that have been corrected in this electronic edition. These corrections were made on the basis of later editions of the Patriarchal text and are listed below. These corrections are also footnoted in the text.
